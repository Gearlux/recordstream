"""The ``Stream`` engine, its fan-in sibling ``JointStream``, and the ops-list plumbing.

``Stream`` is the dataset-surface facade over the one step-graph kernel: an ``ops:`` list is
compiled to POSITIONAL steps by :func:`linear_steps` and run by
:mod:`recordstream.flow`, exactly as a ``flow:`` document's author-named steps are. The two
spellings are the same thing (``docs/architecture.md`` §3).

What else lives here and why:

* ``JointStream`` — 20 lines that exist to be ``Stream.joint``'s return value (§5).
* :func:`linear_steps` / :func:`_worker_task` — both compile or run an ops LIST, which is
  ``Stream``'s spelling of a pipeline.
* :func:`ensure_record_dataset` — its whole body is "already a Stream? else wrap in one".
* the deferred-source guidance helpers — they phrase ``Stream``'s own Fluid errors.

The imports of :mod:`recordstream.flow` are body-local ON PURPOSE: flow imports the op
dispatch from :mod:`recordstream.core.families` at module level, so a top-level import back
would close the cycle.

        """Run the CHEAP chain per record, and re-run the real one when it fell short.

        The verification is the whole safety story, and it is deliberately empirical rather
        than a promise: a cheap op says nothing about which keys it can produce for a given
        file (a sidecar carries annotations for one recording and not the next), so the only
        honest test is whether the record in hand actually carries what was asked for. It is
        :func:`~recordstream.formats.answers`, which counts a placeholder as an absence — a
        cheap answer may keep an entry it could not really supply (a scan's empty sample
        array, so that a survey can read the physics off that item), and a filter handed one
        tests an empty array and answers confidently wrong. The marker rides the VALUE rather
        than the key, so a chain renaming that entry cannot lose it.

        The cheap chain RAISING is the same verdict as falling short: a chain is written
        against the record a full read produces, so an op reaching for something the cheap
        step could not supply is expected, not exceptional — its answer is simply the real
        chain's.

        A record the cheap chain DROPS is not re-run: dropping is a decision about the file
        (a companion half), not about the keys, and the cheap variants make it exactly where
        the real ops do. Measured over a 1430-recording library, one filter term: 3.4 min for
        the ordinary walk against 0.5 s here, 41 records falling back because they carry no
        annotations at all. Partial: a generator.

    """Read ONE whole record, so everything this source builds lazily is built in THIS process.

    The companion to :func:`ensure_record_dataset`: that one normalizes a source's TYPE, this one
    normalizes its STATE. Returns the source, so it composes.

    A source in this package is lazy on purpose — a constructor does no work, and the download /
    file open / client construction happens on first read. That is right until the first read
    happens somewhere it must not, and there is one such place: **a forked child process.**

    Measured, on macOS, 2026-08-02. A ``DataLoader`` worker was the first to touch a
    ``HuggingFaceSource``, so ``load_dataset`` ran in the child, called ``hf_hub_download`` ->
    ``httpx.Client()`` -> ``urllib.request.getproxies`` -> ``_scproxy`` -> CoreFoundation, which
    is not fork-safe: **SIGSEGV**, with no Python traceback, surfacing only as
    ``DataLoader worker exited unexpectedly``. Calling this in the parent first makes the child
    inherit a source that needs nothing, and the crash does not happen. The consumer cannot
    always choose spawn instead — a framework may set the start method globally (fastai sets
    ``fork`` at import), and spawning has its own cost (a model on Apple's MPS cannot be shared
    to a spawned worker at all).

    It reads a whole RECORD rather than asking a cheaper question, and that is the point:
    ``len(source)`` was measured NOT to be enough, because loading the dataset object is not the
    same as building everything a read needs. :func:`~recordstream.first_value` is no substitute
    either — it is projection-aware, so it deliberately avoids building the values it was not
    asked for.

    An empty source is not an error: there is nothing to build, and a caller should not need a
    guard for a split that happens to have no rows.

    """Normalize any wired source into a map-style ``Dataset`` that yields record dicts.

    A wired ``train_set`` / ``val_set`` / ``test_set`` may be a :class:`Stream`, another torch
    ``Dataset``, a recordstream source (``HuggingFaceSource``), or a plain list — and its items
    may be record dicts or raw rows. A ``Stream`` already coerces every item to a record, so:

    * a ``Stream`` is returned as-is (already a ``Dataset`` of records; this preserves a
      subclass's own wrap, e.g. a label-encoding Stream with its ``class_names``), and
    * anything else is wrapped in a ``Stream``, which makes it both a map-style ``Dataset``
      AND a record-yielding one.

    Calling this once up front lets the rest of a training pipeline (target detection, label
    fitting/encoding, collate, metrics) assume record items — no per-call "is this a record?"
    checks. It lives beside :class:`Stream` because that is the only type it knows: the whole
    body is "already a Stream? else wrap in one".

    The parameter admits a ``Fluid`` and ``None`` because both genuinely occur at the call
    sites: a config hands over a deferred marker, and an optional split may be unwired (which
    yields an empty stream, so a caller needs no guard).

    A DEFERRED source (a ``!class:`` marker straight out of a config) is materialized first,
    matching :func:`~recordstream.project` and :meth:`~recordstream.LabelMap.encode`. Without
    it, wrapping a marker produced a ``Stream`` whose source was still a Fluid — which fails
    later, at first iteration, with an error about the Stream rather than about the config that
    caused it. Flowing a live object is a no-op.
