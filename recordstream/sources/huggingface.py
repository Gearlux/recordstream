    """
    RecordStream Source for Hugging Face Datasets, yielding plain record dicts.

    Key mapping (the record layout):

    * the ``input_feature`` value (image / array) -> an :class:`~recordstream.Image` under the
      record key ``"image"``;
    * the ``target_feature`` value (label) -> a :class:`~recordstream.Label` under the record key
      ``"class"``;
    * each ``metadata_features`` column -> its own :class:`~recordstream.Label` keyed by the column
      name, plus the source-provenance ``hf_path`` / ``hf_split`` Labels.

    Partial & zero-arg per the workspace class-design convention (see confluid AGENTS.md
    "Partial Initialization & Zero-Arg Construction"): the constructor only stores values and
    does NO functional work — ``HuggingFaceSource()`` is valid, and the dataset is downloaded
    only on first access to :attr:`dataset` (cached thereafter; reset ``_dataset`` to reload).
    ``path`` is therefore optional at construction and validated lazily when the data is needed.

    It also carries its own IDENTITY (:mod:`recordstream.uri`): :attr:`dataset_uri` names the
    dataset canonically (``hf://datasets/ylecun/mnist?split=train``, or a ``file://`` URI for a
    local imagefolder) and :attr:`dataset_url` links to the Hub viewer for the same rows. Both
    read stored configuration only — asking either never loads anything.

    Args:
        path: HF dataset identifier — a Hub repo id (e.g. ``kitofrank/RFUAV``) or a local imagefolder path.
        split: HF split name (``train`` / ``validation`` / ``test`` / etc.).
        input_feature: Dataset feature column mapped onto the ``"image"`` record key (an ``Image`` item).
        target_feature: Dataset feature column mapped onto the ``"class"`` record key (a ``Label`` item).
        metadata_features: Columns -> per-column ``Label`` entries; ``None``=none, ``"*"``=all-but-i/o, else a list.
        count: Optional cap on the number of records yielded (useful for fast smoke runs).
        name: Optional HF subset/config name (e.g. for multi-config datasets).
        revision: Optional dataset git revision (branch / tag / commit). Declared rather than
            left to ``load_kwargs`` because it is part of the source's IDENTITY — ``dataset_uri``
            reads it.
        load_kwargs: The remaining ``datasets.load_dataset`` options (``token``, ``cache_dir``,
            ``trust_remote_code``, …) as an explicit mapping. A dict rather than ``**kwargs``:
            see the note in ``__init__`` — a ``**kwargs`` constructor accepts every broadcast key
