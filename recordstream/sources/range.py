    The plain-slice counterpart to :class:`~recordstream.sources.DatasetSplit` (which shuffles
    + partitions) — extracted from DatasetSplit's old "range mode". Negative ``start`` /
    ``stop`` count from the end; both are clamped to ``[0, len(source)]``. Partial: only index
    arithmetic happens up front; records are produced on demand.

    The wrapped source must implement ``__len__`` and ``__getitem__``.

    Args:
        source: The underlying indexable source (defaults to ``None``; validated lazily on first use).
        start: Inclusive start index (``None`` ⇒ 0; a negative value counts from the end).

        class does, so it has no reason to make a key-restricted walk more expensive than the
        one it wraps — and without this it did exactly that, because
        :func:`~recordstream.projection.project` takes a source's cheap path only when the
        object handed to it has one. Measured over a source whose records carry 15 MB of
        samples: 0.006 s per record straight from it, 0.423 s through this wrapper, for the
        same records and the same keys.

        Records BEFORE ``start`` are still walked — a projected walk is an iterator, not an
        index — but at the projected cost rather than a full read, and the walk stops at
        ``stop``. Partial: a generator.
