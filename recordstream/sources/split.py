class DatasetSplit:
    """
    Splits an indexable source into reproducible ``train`` / ``val`` / ``test`` views.

    A ``source`` (it yields records and is wired into a trainer's ``source:`` slot),
    not an engine — it applies no ops, it just exposes a reproducible partition of another
    source. (For a contiguous index slice use :class:`~recordstream.sources.RangeSource`; to
    concatenate several sources use :class:`~recordstream.sources.ConcatSource`.)

    **Property API (preferred).** Configure ONE ``DatasetSplit`` with ``seed`` and the
    held-out fraction(s) (``val_fraction`` and/or ``test_fraction``) and read the three
    cached view sources off it::

        split = DatasetSplit(source=src, val_fraction=0.1, test_fraction=0.1, seed=42)
        split.train   # ≈80% — the remainder
        split.val     # ≈10%
        split.test    # ≈10%

    The views are disjoint and complementary, computed once (cached) over a single
    deterministic shuffle. In a config each view is a ``DatasetSplit`` of its own with the
    ``split`` selector set — the recipe is written once (a YAML anchor) and merged (``<<:``)
    into the other views. Every view references the SAME ``source`` (``!ref:`` shares the
    instance), so the upstream source is loaded exactly once; a ``DatasetSplit``'s own
    partition is one seeded shuffle over ``len(source)``, cheap to repeat::

        train_set: !class:recordstream.core.stream.Stream()
          source: &split_recipe !class:recordstream.sources.split.DatasetSplit()
            source: !ref:hf_train
            val_fraction: 0.1
            test_fraction: 0.1
            seed: 42
            split: train
        val_set: !class:recordstream.core.stream.Stream()
          source: !class:recordstream.sources.split.DatasetSplit()
            <<: *split_recipe
            split: val

    (Reading a view by attribute reference — ``!ref:my_split.train`` — is no longer a
    config spelling; the config engine refuses it and names this rewrite.)

    **Select-one API.** Passing ``split`` makes the ``DatasetSplit`` itself iterate that one
    view (``split=None`` ⇒ ``train``), so it is directly usable as a single ``source:``.

    Omit ``test_fraction`` for a plain two-way train/val split; omit both fractions for a
    degenerate split where ``train`` is the whole source and ``val`` / ``test`` are empty.

    The wrapped source must implement ``__len__`` and ``__getitem__``. Partial: only index
    arithmetic happens up front; records are produced on demand.

    Args:
        source: The underlying indexable source (defaults to ``None``; validated lazily on first use).
        split: View this iterates as a source — ``train`` / ``val`` / ``test`` (``None`` ⇒ ``train``).
        val_fraction: Fraction of records assigned to the ``val`` view. Must be in ``(0, 1)``.
        test_fraction: Fraction of records assigned to the ``test`` view. Must be in ``(0, 1)``.
        seed: Seed for the deterministic shuffle. Required when any fraction is set.
