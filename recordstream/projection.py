"""Key projection for RecordStream sources — read only the record keys you need.

Walking a source for a single key (the canonical case: counting classes from the label
key) should not pay for constructing the values you don't need — e.g. decoding image
inputs you are about to throw away. This module adds an **opt-in** projection protocol
plus walk helpers that any consumer can use against any source, with a correct (if
unoptimized) fallback for sources that don't implement the protocol.

The primitive is deliberately general (any subset of record KEYS); :func:`num_classes`
is one helper built on top of it.

Design notes
------------
* :class:`SupportsProjection` is a ``Protocol`` (never a base class), so a source
  opts in by *defining* ``project``, not by inheriting.
* Every public function is a lazy generator (**Partial Evaluation** mandate) —
  nothing materializes the whole source.
* :func:`num_classes` (integer class-id semantics) is a free function, *not* a
  method on the generic :class:`~recordstream.core.stream.Stream` engine — counting classes is
  a classification concern, and bolting it onto the task-agnostic engine would
  make every ``Stream`` look classification-capable to duck-typed consumers.

    :func:`project` or it silently discards its source's efficient path (measured on a signal
    corpus of 15 MB records: 0.006 s per record straight from the source, 0.423 s through a
    wrapper that read each one whole for the same keys) — and forwarding is not simply
    ``project(source, keys)`` because the wrapper owns which records, and in what order.

    Laziness follows the ORDER asked for, because that is the only thing that decides whether
    it can. Indices that increase — a contiguous slice, an unshuffled split — stream straight
    through, holding nothing. An index that arrives out of order is held until its turn comes,
    so a reordered view holds at most the records between its own extremes. What is held is a
    PROJECTED record (the entries asked for), never the payload the projection exists to skip,
    which is what keeps a reordered view affordable where materializing the source is not.

    The walk stops as soon as the last wanted index has been delivered, so a window at the
    front of a large source costs the front of it. Partial: a generator.
