    """Run a task model on ONE record and stamp its prediction as a record field.

    The model is any callable ``model(batch)`` — typically a project's checkpointed
    wrapper. Its real work (build the network, load the checkpoint) happens in its
    ``solidify()``, called lazily on the first record, so constructing this op is free.
    What gets stamped follows the field conventions a viewer reads back as layers:

    - ``classification``: ``output`` = the predicted class as a :class:`~recordstream.items.Label`
      (output shape ``[1, C]`` probs/logits, or a mapping/object with ``probs``/``logits``);
    - ``detection``: ``output`` = a :class:`~recordstream.items.Boxes` (per-image
      ``boxes``/``scores``/``labels``, pixel xyxy);
    - ``segmentation``: ``<output>_mask`` = an int class mask ``[H, W]`` (argmax over
      ``[C, H, W]`` logits when needed);
    - ``restoration``: ``output`` = the restored image array (channels-first is moved last).

    Args:
        model: The callable model (a checkpointed wrapper; solidified on first use).
        kind: What the model's output means — ``classification`` / ``detection`` /
            ``segmentation`` / ``restoration``.
        key: Record field fed to the model.
        output: Record field stamped with the prediction (``segmentation`` stamps
            ``<output>_mask``).
        device: Where a torch model runs — ``auto`` (default) picks the best available
            (cuda > mps > cpu); naming an absent one raises listing this machine's
            devices. Ignored for a model without a ``.to``.
        score: Classification only — record field the CONFIDENCE (max probability) is
            ADDED under, as a ``Label``. ``""`` disables it. Declared AFTER ``device``
            on purpose: canvas widget values are POSITIONAL, so a new parameter is
            APPENDED — inserting one mid-signature shifts every later widget on a saved
            canvas converted by a not-yet-restarted editor (measured: ``device: score``).
        batch_size: How many records a batching RUNNER may hand :meth:`predict_batch` per
            forward. ``0`` (default) = no opinion — the runner's own default decides;
            set it on the node to pin this model's limit. Appended last (see ``score``).
        frame: Detection only — the record entry whose SIZE the stamped boxes map to.
            A model fed a resized copy (a DETR postprocesses to its own square) answers in
            model space; naming the ORIGINAL image here scales boxes and canvas back to it.
            ``""`` keeps the input's own frame. Appended last (widget order rule).
