"""``Enable`` — toggle one or more ops on/off from a single declared flag.

A compose-group op (alongside ``Pipeline`` / ``Parallel``): wrap an inner op-list
so the whole chain can be switched on or off from ONE boolean, ``enabled``.
Modality-neutral — it threads any record through any ops — so it lives in core
recordstream, not a domain package.

class Enable:
    """Wrap one or more ops so the whole chain can be switched on or off.

    ``ops`` is a list; even a single-op guard uses ``ops: [op]``. The wrapper
    threads each record through every op in sequence — same semantics as
    listing them inline in ``Stream.ops`` — so a whole visualization chain
    shares one toggle instead of needing a wrapper per op.

    The toggle is ``enabled``: a DECLARED constructor parameter exposed as a
    settable property. Being declared is what makes it reachable from every
    front-end — a YAML key, a CLI override, a Python kwarg, a generated
    tool/form schema, a canvas widget — through the same introspection every
    other ``@configurable`` parameter uses. There is no dynamic toggle-attribute
    naming: an unrecognised boolean key on this class is an error, not a flag.

    Several wrappers in one pipeline are told apart by ``name``, which scopes
    the CLI flag to that instance (``--<name>.enabled``); a bare ``--enabled``
    still broadcasts to every wrapper at once.

    YAML:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - !class:recordstream.ops.enable.Enable
          name: visualize             # ← names THIS instance; scopes its CLI flag
          enabled: false
          ops:
            - !class:recordstream.ops.image.ConvertToImage {}
            - !class:recordstream.ops.debug.PrintRecordOp {}

    CLI:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Targeted — only the wrapper named `visualize` flips.
        recordstream run pipeline.yaml --visualize.enabled true
        recordstream run pipeline.yaml --visualize.enabled+   # polarity shorthand → True
        recordstream run pipeline.yaml --visualize.enabled-   # polarity shorthand → False

        # Broadcast — every Enable in the config flips.
        recordstream run pipeline.yaml --enabled false

    Python:

    .. code-block:: python

        op = Enable(ops=[convert, save], name="visualize", enabled=False)
        op.enabled = True     # plain attribute write (validated: must be a bool)

    Inner ops stay deferred (not materialized) until the wrapper actually
    fires for the first time, so guarding expensive-to-construct ops with
    ``enabled: false`` costs nothing at startup.

    Constraints:
      * ``ops`` is required and must be a non-empty list — validated **lazily**
        on first call (zero-arg construction stays valid per the recordstream
        "Partial Initialization & Zero-Arg Construction" convention).
      * ``enabled`` must be a ``bool``; a non-bool raises ``TypeError`` at set time. Through the
        constructor, confluid's validation first turns an accepted ``"true"`` / ``"false"`` into the
        bool and refuses any other string.
      * Any OTHER boolean attribute set on the wrapper raises ``ValueError`` on
        first call. That is the migration guard for the retired dynamic-toggle
        form (``visualize: false`` as a bare kwarg), which would otherwise be
        accepted silently by the post-construction paradigm and never read.

    Args:
        ops: Non-empty list of ops (native or bare library transforms) gated by the toggle.
        enabled: Whether the wrapped ops fire. Settable post-construction, from YAML,
            and from the CLI (``--enabled`` / ``--<name>.enabled``).
        name: Identifier for THIS instance — scopes its CLI flag to ``--<name>.enabled``
            and labels it in ``--help``. Empty (the default) leaves it unnamed, reachable
            only by the broadcast form.
