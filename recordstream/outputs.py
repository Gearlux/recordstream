"""Prediction-output contracts — what a model hands to a sink, metric, or visualizer.

Every model's eval-mode ``forward`` should return one of these — or a task-specific superset.
The keys *are* the documentation: downstream metrics, sinks, visualizers, and evaluators
inspect known keys instead of guessing whether a tensor is logits, probabilities, or argmax'd
class ids. That guess is not hypothetical: two independently-written detector wrappers agree
that ``boxes`` is xyxy in absolute pixels only because :class:`DetectionOutput` says so.

**Generic in the array type.** Each contract is a generic ``TypedDict`` parameterized by the
array type it carries, so the SAME contract describes a torch run, a numpy/JAX run, or a
TensorFlow one::

    ClassificationOutput[Tensor]      # a torch model
    ClassificationOutput[np.ndarray]  # a numpy / TF / JAX model

The parameter is optional — a bare ``ClassificationOutput`` means "whatever array type".

**Why here.** These describe the boundary between a model and whatever consumes its output,
and the consumer this package ships is :mod:`recordstream.predictions` — the sink that reads
``probs`` / ``class_idx`` by name. A contract owned by a different package than its reader is
how "it lives there because that other thing lives there" starts.

The BUILDERS (bottom of this module) are necessarily per-framework — ``softmax`` and ``argmax``
are library calls, not type declarations — and are torch, like the rest of this package's tensor
surface. A backend on another framework adds its own builders beside these; it does NOT redefine
the contracts.

    ``class_idx``. A restoration model emits the answer directly, so what a consumer needs told
    is precisely that: the array under ``image`` is a picture in the input's units, NOT logits
    to be softmaxed and NOT a residual to be added back. A sink that writes a PNG, a PSNR metric
    and a viewer all read it the same way because this says so.

    The residual (what the model removed) is deliberately absent: it is ``input - image``, and a
    contract key that a consumer can compute is a second place for the two to disagree.
