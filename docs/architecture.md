# RecordStream architecture

The *why* behind recordstream's module boundaries and mechanisms. The user-facing documentation
([README](../README.md), the per-topic `docs/*.md`) shows **how to use** each surface; this
document records **why the surface is shaped the way it is** — so a reader who asks "why does this
module exist?" finds the answer here instead of reverse-engineering it from git history.

Maintenance rules:

- Every record keeps the five elements **Context → Decision → Consequences → Example → What you
  may change**, dated (see the workspace `AGENTS.md` → "Architecture Decisions Are Documented").
- A change that alters a mechanism updates its record **in the same change**.
- A superseded decision is **deleted**, not archived: whatever it still binds is folded into its
  successor record. History lives in git, not here.

## 1. The record data model and the type-dispatched op engine (2026-07-25)

### Context

The rejected alternative was a bespoke record container: typed items (that part was right)
wrapped in a `Record` class with per-key role tags, plus an adapter registry that wrapped every
external library transform in an adapter object before it could touch a record (two adapter
classes, a coercion registry, and ~170 generated per-transform wrapper ops — all maintenance
surface). The container was the friction point: role tags duplicated what key names already say
(`"mask"` *is* the mask), and dict-native libraries — torchvision `transforms.v2` walks dicts,
albumentations takes named kwargs — were kept at arm's length from a carrier they could have
consumed directly. With two op-authoring surfaces (native transforms vs the adapter/generated
families), "where does augmentation come from?" had three answers.

### Decision

Collapse to ONE carrier and ONE op engine:

- **A record is a plain `dict`** — `recordstream.items.Record = Dict[str, Any]` — of **typed
  values** (`Image`/`Mask`/`Boxes`/`Label`, base `NDArrayItem`; open registry `register_item`;
  uniform payload accessors `item_data`/`with_data`). No container class, no roles, no
  `primary()`: **key names carry meaning** (`"image"`, `"mask"`, `"bboxes"`, `"class"`), and a
  scalar side value is just another key. Metadata is attrs on the typed value (`Image.layout`,
  `Label.classes`) or more dict keys (`"samplerate": 30.72e6`). Items are deliberately NOT
  confluid-`@configurable`: an ndarray subclass builds through `__new__`, which fights the
  `__init__` validation wrap — they live in their own registry.
- **Native ops are type-dispatched `Transform`s** (`recordstream/transform.py`):
  `get_params(record)` draws shared parameters ONCE per record, per-type kernels
  (`@MyOp.kernel(ItemType)`, MRO-aware registry in `recordstream/dispatch.py`) apply to every
  handled value, `field=` pins one key. The second sanctioned shape — type-CHANGING ops
  (`Threshold`: array→`Mask`, `ConvertToImage`: array→`Image`, `ConnectedComponents`:
  `Mask`→`Boxes`, the target ops) — overrides `__call__`, resolves its source by an explicit
  `field=` or the first value of the natural type, and raises a `ValueError` naming the record's
  keys on every miss.
- **External libraries run AS-IS through the engine's op-family dispatch**
  (`recordstream.core.families._apply_op`): an albumentations op receives exactly its own kwarg vocabulary
  (`image`/`mask`/`masks`/`bboxes`/`keypoints`/`labels` keys present in the record; one call =
  one joint draw; array outputs re-wrapped in the incoming `NDArrayItem` type so `Image`/`Mask`
  survive); a torchvision-v2 op is called on the dict as-is; everything else is `op(record)` with
  `None` = drop. **The families are an open registry** — `register_op_family(name, matcher,
  invoker)`; the built-ins register through the same API, dispatch checks last-registered first,
  and matchers/invokers are module-level functions so spawn workers rebuild the registry. Family
  detection is by MRO module name — no eager imports, no adapters, no generated wrappers.
  Box-carrying augmentation is the library's own `A.Compose(..., bbox_params=...)`; seeding is
  the libraries' own mechanisms.
- **`Pipeline(transforms=[...])`** (`recordstream/transform.py`) is THE sequential composer; every
  composing op routes inner ops through `_apply_op`, so bare library transforms nest anywhere a
  native op does.
- **Tensors are plain values.** `ToTensor` writes a LIVE CHW `torch.Tensor` (the payload's own element type) under its key —
  a record value can be anything (`collate_records` stacks tensors natively, storage converts via
  `to_numpy` on write, a downstream tv2 op transforms them as-is). An `Image` itself cannot hold
  a tensor (`NDArrayItem.__new__` runs `np.asarray`); a typed tensor ITEM base is a tracked
  follow-up (root `TASKS.md`).
- **Storage is the record key-group layout** (`typedrecord-v1`): everything serializes through
  the `recordstream/io.py` codec; plain values ride the `"plain"` tag; NO backward compatibility
  with the pre-record layout (an old/untagged store raises via
  `storage/base.py::require_record_format` — an explicit decision: re-generate, never accrete
  legacy readers).
- **Projection and collation are key-addressed**: `project(source, keys)` / `iter_key` /
  `num_classes(key="class")`; the collate registry's default is `"record"` = `collate_records`.

### Consequences

- Zero adapter surface: a new library version's transforms are available the moment the library
  is — nothing to regenerate; a NEW library family is one `register_op_family` call from any
  package.
- Cross-key consistency is the LIBRARY's own joint draw (albumentations Compose / tv2's dict
  walk) for augmentation, and `get_params`-once for native ops — one mechanism per world, both
  automatic.
- YAML needs no special forms: a bare `!class:albumentations.HorizontalFlip {p: 0.5}` sits in an
  `ops:` list like any native op (deferred markers flow at route entry).
- The albumentations vocabulary is load-bearing: a value augments only if it rides one of the
  library's key names — routing is an explicit `RenameField`, never engine magic.
- **Contracts that outlive refactors:** the HALF-OPEN pixel xyxy `(x0, y0, x1, y1)` order of
  `connected_component_boxes` (every `Boxes` producer emits it; a downstream back-projection
  reads exactly that order); the `typedrecord-v1` tag + no-back-compat rule; the albumentations
  key vocabulary; the `"module:qualname"` callable-path format (§4).
- Anything that used the old container API must migrate — there are deliberately no aliases and
  no legacy read path.

### Example

One `Stream` ops list mixing both worlds, no wrappers:

```python
import albumentations as A
from recordstream import Stream, Image, as_transform

stream = Stream(source=records, ops=[
    A.Compose([A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5)],
              bbox_params=A.BboxParams(format="pascal_voc", label_fields=["labels"])),
    A.GaussNoise(p=1.0),                                 # bare library op — as-is
    as_transform(lambda d: d - 0.5, handles=(Image,)),   # native type-dispatched op
])
```

The same shape in YAML:

```yaml
ops:
  - !class:albumentations.HorizontalFlip
    p: 0.5
  - !class:recordstream.ops.numpy.Threshold
    low_level: 0.5
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **A new item type** — one class + `@register_item` (array-backed: subclass `NDArrayItem`,
  declare `_item_attrs`); usage in [record-model.md](record-model.md).
- **A new per-type behaviour for an existing op** — `@Op.kernel(ItemType)`, no core edit.
- **A new library family** — one `register_op_family(name, matcher, invoker)` call from any
  package (MRO module-name matcher + the library's native calling convention; module-level
  functions so spawn workers rebuild the registry). Never an adapter/wrapper class. The
  built-ins register through the same API; dispatch is last-registered-first, so
  forks/extensions shadow their base library by registering later. Usage:
  [record-model.md](record-model.md) → "A new library family".
- **The `typedrecord-v1` tag and the no-back-compat rule are contracts** — changing the on-disk
  layout means a NEW tag and a re-generation story, never a silent dual-read path.

### Amendment: an array item carries its attributes through pickle (2026-09-27)

`__array_finalize__` carries an item's attributes through every numpy construction path, but
pickling is not one of them. numpy's `ndarray.__reduce__` stores the array only. On load it
rebuilds the object through a bare `ndarray.__new__` (never `NDArrayItem.__new__`), and
`__array_finalize__` receives no source object. So every declared attribute fell back to its
class default. Pickling is how a record crosses a spawn worker, and it broke silently in both
directions. Measured: an `Image` with `layout="CHW"` arrived in the worker as `"HWC"`, an
`Image` built in the worker came back as `"HWC"`, and a `db` spectrogram reached a
`.parallel(2)` worker as `scaling="none"`, which a dB-only op then refused. Serial runs never
pickle and were unaffected, which is why nothing showed it.

`NDArrayItem` therefore defines `__reduce__` / `__setstate__`: numpy's own state, plus a dict of
the `_item_attrs` values, restored after numpy's `__setstate__`. It sits on the base class, so an
array item type registered by a domain package gets it without writing anything. Storage is a
separate path and does not use it: backends go through the item codec (`recordstream/io.py`),
which already wrote the attributes explicitly, and the directory backend loads with
`allow_pickle=False`. So the fix changes no on-disk format.

```python
import pickle
from recordstream import Image

img = Image(rgb_chw, layout="CHW")
pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(img)).layout   # "CHW" (was "HWC", the class default)
```

What you may change: a subclass may override either method, but it must EXTEND the base ones
(call `super()` and add to the state), never replace them. The pins in `tests/test_items.py`
(`TestPickle`) round-trip every registered array item type at every pickle protocol, and through
`Stream(...).parallel(2)` and `FlowGraph(...).parallel(2)`.

## 2. Batching is two-stage; collation is a pluggable registry (`recordstream.collate`, 2026-07-17)

### Context

Turning N pipeline items into one batched carrier has two distinct halves:

1. **Grouping** — the engine yields groups of N items (`Stream.batch` / `FlowGraph.batch` yield
   `list`s, and a torch `DataLoader` hands its `collate_fn` a list).
2. **Stacking** — a *collate function* turns one group into one batched carrier.

The engine owns grouping; it must NOT own stacking, because stacking is task-shaped: historically
every consuming project shipped its own task collate (classification, segmentation, detection),
and divergent batched-metadata conventions emerged between them.

### Decision

`recordstream/collate.py` is a **pluggable registry of collate functions keyed by representation**:
`register_collate(key)` / `get_collate(key)` / `collate(items, key=None)`, where an omitted key
uses the default **`"record"`** collate (`collate_records`) — N plain record dicts into ONE
batched record: per key, typed values encode through the `recordstream/io.py` codec, payloads stack
(torch → stacked tensor, numpy → stacked array, else a list), each declared item attr becomes a
LIST of per-record values (decoded back into one batched item of the same type), and a
`"plain"`-tagged value batches as the plain list. Batches must be key-homogeneous — a mismatch
raises. Consuming projects register task aliases (`"detection"`, `"yolo"`, …) **additively**;
re-registering a key deliberately overwrites so a consumer can replace a default. The divergent
consumer conventions were deliberately NOT unified here — the registry is an addressable home
consumers opt into, not a forced migration.

The open, string-keyed half of the registry exists first and foremost for **AI-callable tools**
(the workspace converges on an MCP tool surface — see the root `AGENTS.md` end-goal): a JSON tool
argument can carry `"collate": "yolo"` but never a Python function object, and a tool schema can
offer the legal values only if the set is discoverable at runtime (`registered_collates()`). In
ordinary Python (and in YAML via a dotted `!ref:` to the function), passing the collate function
directly remains the normal path.

### Consequences

- The engine stays task-agnostic: recordstream stacks by key + item type, never
  classification/detection/….
- Item metadata batches deterministically: per-record attrs become lists on the ONE batched item
  (`batch["image"].layout == ["HWC", "HWC", ...]`), plain values become plain lists — there is
  no second batched-metadata convention in this package.
- A task whose batch shape the generic rules cannot express (detection's ragged per-record
  boxes) opts OUT entirely and emits its model family's native contract — see the worked
  example in [record-model.md](record-model.md) → "Batching".
- Registration happens at module import, so a key exists only after its defining module has been
  imported.

### Example

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

from recordstream import Stream, collate, collate_records, get_collate, register_collate

stream = Stream(source=my_source, ops=[...])

batch = collate([stream[0], stream[1]])                  # the "record" default
batch["image"].shape                                 # stacked payloads, one batched Image
batch["image"].layout                                # per-record attrs -> a list

loader = DataLoader(stream, batch_size=8, collate_fn=collate_records)


# A task alias registers additively (runs when the defining module is imported).
@register_collate("yolo")
def yolo_collate(items):
    ...  # stack to the task's own batch layout


loader = DataLoader(stream, batch_size=8, collate_fn=get_collate("yolo"))
```

### Addendum: the READ-BACK lives here too (`recordstream.batch`, 2026-07-29)

**Context.** Every model boundary has to undo the three rules above: get past a wrapper item,
turn a per-record list into one tensor, transpose the leftover columns into per-record dicts for
a predictions sink. That is not task knowledge — it is the collate's own convention read
backwards. Two consumer packages had independently written it: one for classification, one for
segmentation, with two near-identical private `_batch_metadata` implementations and two separate
test files pinning them. A third consumer would have written a third.

**Decision.** `recordstream.batch` ships the inverse beside the collate — `batch_values`,
`batch_tensor`, `batch_metadata` — and it carries **no dtype or shape opinion**. Rule 2 above
says turning class names into an `[N]` int64 tensor is "the model boundary's one explicit step,
not a generic-engine guess"; that still holds. What moved is *reading*, not *shaping*.

**Consequences.** The three shapes a consumer actually wants — a classifier's `[N]` int64 ids, a
multi-label trainer's `[N, C]` float multi-hot, a segmenter's `[N, H, W]` int64 mask — all start
from `batch_values` and are shaped by a small task-specific function the consumer keeps. Folding
those three into one shared helper would produce a function whose body is a task switch, which
is the thing the collate registry exists to avoid.

**Example.**

```python
from recordstream import batch_tensor, batch_values, batch_metadata

x = batch_tensor(batch, "image", device=self.device)      # generic: one [N, 3, H, W] tensor
meta = batch_metadata(batch, exclude=("image", "class"))  # generic: N per-record dicts

# task-specific, stays in the consumer:
ids = torch.as_tensor(batch_values(batch, "class"))       # a classifier's [N] class ids
mask = batch_tensor(batch, "target").long()               # a segmenter's [N, H, W] int64 mask
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Plugging in your own batch layout** is the supported extension point — decorate a function
  with `@register_collate("your-key")` and select it via `get_collate`/`collate`. Usage:
  [kinds.md](kinds.md); the detection walkthrough: [record-model.md](record-model.md).
- **Changing the default collate's semantics** (how `"record"` stacks, the attrs-become-lists
  convention) is an architectural change: every batch consumer depends on it. Update this record
  and the recordstream `AGENTS.md` metadata mandate together.
- **Adding a reader** to `recordstream.batch` is fine when it is the collate read backwards.
  Adding one that shapes for a task (promotes a dtype, builds a multi-hot) is not — that belongs
  to the consumer, or the helper becomes a task switch.

## 3. The graph IS the execution model — the lowering pass was deleted (2026-07-30)

*(Supersedes "The per-record Context is an ambient wiring plane", 2026-07-17.)*

### Context

Between 2026-07-17 and 2026-07-30 this package had two ways to run a pipeline. A `flow:`
document (named steps, explicit `from:`/`merge_from:`/`bind:` edges) was the readable authoring
form; a flat `ops:` list was the execution form. A **lowering pass** (`to_ops`) compiled the
first into the second by inserting six *context ops* — `Save`/`Use`/`Drop`/`Apply`/`Capture`/
`MergeFields` — that moved records through an ambient per-record cell store, and a **lifting
pass** (`from_ops`) reconstructed a flow document from such a list. Execution parity in both
directions was a pinned contract with its own suite.

The arrangement was coherent but it cost a second executor (`FlowGraph` duplicating `Stream`'s
iteration, length, indexing and batching while being strictly less capable — no `to_sink`, no
`project`, and a `NotImplementedError` on 1→N expanding steps), a permanent parity tax on every
change to an op's semantics, and an ambient `contextvars` plane that nothing in the workspace's
15 real configs ever used. Adoption told the story plainly: every config on disk was a linear
`ops:` list; zero were `flow:` documents; the only producer of branchy pipelines — the visual
editor — compiled its canvas graph *down* to context ops and then lifted it *back* to a flow
document purely for readability.

The decisive argument was about the consumer nobody had built yet. A lowered list re-encodes
dataflow as imperative mutation of named cells, which is exactly the information a compiler
needs and cannot recover: reverse-dependency analysis walks `node.inputs` backwards from the
outputs, and a flat list has no inputs. Handing a compiler the lowered form means asking it to
run the lifting pass first to rebuild what was just destroyed.

### Decision

**One execution model: the step graph.** Both spellings parse to the same `FlowStep` list and run
through the same per-record kernel (`recordstream.flow.execute.run_steps_multi`).

- An `ops:` list compiles to positional steps (`core.linear_steps` — `s0`, `s1`, …) whose names
  never surface. A sequence IS a graph; no lifting is involved.
- A `flow:` document parses to the same steps with author-chosen names and explicit edges.
- The kernel takes an **env-free fast path** for a straight chain (`is_linear`), so the linear
  case carries none of the graph bookkeeping.
- `to_ops`, `from_ops`, `Stream.from_flow_yaml`, `recordstream.context` and
  `recordstream.ops.context` are **deleted**, with no back-compat shims.

Fan-out, fan-in and cross-step values are expressed as step GRAMMAR rather than as ops: `from:`
is the fork, `merge_from:` the union, `bind:` the cross-step value (including a producer's live
`@output` via `step.attr`). Branch isolation, which the cell store provided by deep-copying on
read, is now a property of the environment: each expansion branch gets its own shallow copy of
the step env, and a fan-out read copies.

### Consequences

- **One executor.** `Stream` and `FlowGraph` are two facades over one kernel; the parity suite is
  gone because there is nothing left to keep in parity.
- **Expanding ops work everywhere.** The graph gained 1→N support (the remaining subgraph runs per
  child, depth-first) that the old `FlowGraph` refused outright.
- **A branchy pipeline has no flat spelling — deliberately.** `FlowGraph.to_stream()` raises for
  one, and a visual editor's ops-export raises pointing at its flow export. This is the honest
  consequence of deleting the pass that manufactured such a spelling.
- **Compilation becomes possible.** A backend reads `FlowGraph.steps` and maps each step to an IR
  node with real `inputs`; reverse-dependency pruning runs on the result.
- **Measured cost:** on a 23-step pipeline of trivial ops the graph engine was 1.41x the old flat
  loop; hoisting a per-record analysis pass and adding the linear fast path brought it to 1.02x,
  and with real ops in the chain the difference is not measurable.
- **Lost with the cell store:** a hand-written wiring op that stashed a value under its own cell
  name. Anything that must persist belongs in the record; anything that wires belongs in the
  grammar.

### Example

```yaml
# Fan-out -> two branches -> fan-in, entirely in step grammar. No cells, no snapshots.
flow:
  spec:   !class:mypkg.MakeSpectrogram {}
  masked: !class:recordstream.ops.numpy.Threshold {low_level: 0.5, from: spec}
  boost:  !class:mypkg.Boost {from: spec}          # second reader of `spec` = the fork
  out:    {from: boost, merge_from: [masked]}      # union, last-write-wins
outputs: out
```

```python
# The same graph, and what a compiler front end reads off it.
from recordstream.flow import parse_flow

steps, outputs = parse_flow(doc["flow"], doc["outputs"])
for step in steps:
    print(step.name, "<-", step.from_, step.merge_from)   # every edge, explicit
# out <- boost ('masked',)
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Adding a step-grammar key** is an architectural change: it widens the contract every consumer
  (the engine, a compiler front end, a visual editor's compiler) reads. Update this record, the
  `AGENTS.md` flow mandate, and [graph.md](graph.md) together.
- **The linear fast path** (`is_linear`) is an optimization, not a semantic: it must produce
  results identical to the general path, and the suite pins that both spellings agree.
- **Do NOT reintroduce a lowering pass.** A flat list that encodes branches as cell mutations is
  a second execution model wearing the first one's clothes; the reason it was removed is written
  above. If a future runtime genuinely needs a flattened schedule, it owns that pass — over its
  own IR, downstream of the graph.

## 4. Callable↔string serialization + passive introspection (`recordstream.discovery`, 2026-07-20)

### Context

Two workspace mandates — *Serialization Symmetry* (every pipeline round-trips through Confluid
YAML) and *Passive Introspection* (tools discover pipeline pieces without hand-written
definitions) — need a bridge the Confluid registry deliberately does not provide. The registry is
a **curated, opt-in catalog**: classes *and* builder functions participate, but only after an
explicit `@configurable`/`register()`, keyed by name/category/task/role, resolving *strings →
callables* for config materialization. What it does NOT do: produce a string **from** a live
callable (the dump direction a bare-function value like a mapped transform needs), resolve a
callable out of a plain `.py` script or `__main__`, or walk a module to introspect every callable
*defined in it* — registered or not.

### Decision

`recordstream/discovery.py` is one small stdlib-only module with **two halves**:

- **Serialization** — `get_callable_path(fn)` → an importable `"module:qualname"` string
  (resolving `__main__` to the script filename so the path survives process boundaries) and
  `resolve_callable(path)` back to the live object (module import, `.py`-file load, or an
  already-callable passthrough).
- **Introspection** — `introspect_callable(fn)` → a JSON-serializable schema (path, name, doc,
  per-parameter type/default/required), and `scan_module(module_or_py)` applying it to every
  callable *defined in* a module (`__module__`-filtered, so imports don't leak in).

Curated discovery (MCP form-specs, task/category option pickers) deliberately does **not** use
this module — it builds on the Confluid registry. The two surfaces answer different questions:
`scan_module` reflects over *a module, no curation required*; the registry resolves *a curated
name/category*.

### Consequences

- `WrappedOp` stores its callable as the string path and resolves it lazily — which is exactly
  what makes it pickle across `spawn` workers and serialize into YAML verbatim.
- The dotted-path idiom became the workspace's generic **string-callable hook pattern**:
  consuming packages resolve their own hook knobs (metadata encoders, exporter callables) through
  `resolve_callable` instead of hand-rolling import dances.
- A visual editor's node bridge scans op/source modules and auto-generates one node (plus its
  property-panel widgets) per callable — no manual node definitions anywhere.
- The `__module__ == module` filter in `scan_module` is a real contract: a class defined
  elsewhere and merely *imported* into a module is invisible to it (registry-based passes exist
  for that case).
- **One acknowledged overlap**: `resolve_callable`'s plain module-import branch resolves the same
  importable-function targets confluid's `resolve_class` module-path branch / `!ref:` grammar can
  — two spellings of one job. The non-overlapping remainder (path *production*, `.py`-file and
  `__main__` handling, module scans) is why the module exists; whether the resolution half should
  delegate to confluid is a tracked follow-up in the root `TASKS.md`.

### Example

```python
import numpy as np

from recordstream.discovery import get_callable_path, resolve_callable, scan_module

path = get_callable_path(np.sqrt)     # "numpy:sqrt" — YAML/pickle-safe identity
fn = resolve_callable(path)           # back to the live callable
fn is resolve_callable(fn)            # an already-callable argument passes through

schemas = scan_module("recordstream.ops.numpy")   # one JSON schema per op defined there
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Adding a string-callable knob to your own class**: reuse `resolve_callable` (the
  `WrappedOp.f` pattern) — never write a bespoke import dance.
- **The `"module:qualname"` format and the module-local scan filter are contracts** — serialized
  pipelines and node bridges depend on both; changing either is an architectural change that must
  update this record.

## 5. The engine's own callable wrappers live in `core` (2026-07-20; still true after the 2026-08-01 package split)

> **Note (2026-08-01).** `core.py` became the `core/` PACKAGE (§11). Everything below holds
> unchanged — the split preserved exactly the property this record protects. `FilterOp` and
> `WrappedOp` moved to `core/wrappers.py` and `JointStream` sits beside `Stream` in
> `core/stream.py`, still inside `core`, still importing one way. What a config SPELLS changed
> (`!class:recordstream.core.wrappers.FilterOp`); what depends on whom did not.

### Context

Three classes sit in `core` next to the `Stream` engine that look, at first glance, like they
belong elsewhere: `FilterOp` and `WrappedOp` (op-shaped, so why not `ops/`?) and `JointStream`
(a second engine in the engine module).

### Decision

They stay in `core` because of **who constructs them and which way imports flow**. All three
are the construction targets of `Stream`'s own fluent API — `.filter(pred)` appends a `FilterOp`,
`.map(fn)` appends a `WrappedOp`, `Stream.joint([...])` wraps a `JointStream` — so the engine itself
instantiates them. And `core` is the *bottom* of the op-facing layer: every composing op in
`ops/` imports `core._apply_op` (the op-family dispatch chokepoint); moving `FilterOp`/`WrappedOp`
into `ops/` would make `core` import from `ops` and close an import cycle. `JointStream` is
`Stream`'s iteration-only fan-in sibling (`category="engine"`), 20 lines that exist to be
`Stream.joint`'s return value — a module of its own would be structure for structure's sake
(`FlowGraph` earns its separate module by size and its own document grammar).

`FilterOp`/`WrappedOp` carry **no discovery category** on purpose: they wrap a *raw Python
callable*, which no GUI can wire, so they are neither canvas ops nor sources — bare
`@configurable` keeps them YAML-round-trippable while the positive category allowlist keeps them
off visual canvases.

### Consequences

- `ops/` stays a pure consumer of `core` — the layering is one-directional.
- `WrappedOp` is a package-root export (the public "lift a plain function" surface, and its
  stored-string `f` is the reference use of the discovery serialization half); `FilterOp` is not
  root-exported (normally reached via `Stream.filter`; importable as `recordstream.core.wrappers.FilterOp`).
- `JointStream` is YAML-addressable (`!class:recordstream.core.stream.JointStream()`) and canvas-composable as
  an engine node; its indexable counterpart for raw sources is `ConcatSource`.

### Example

```python
stream = (
    Stream(source=src)
    .map(np.sqrt, key="image")                      # appends WrappedOp(f="numpy:sqrt", key="image")
    .filter(lambda r: float(r["image"].max()) > 0)  # appends FilterOp(p=...)
)
both = Stream.joint([stream_a, stream_b])                 # Stream(source=JointStream([stream_a, stream_b]))
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **A new engine-constructed helper** (another fluent-API target) belongs in `core` for the
  same import-direction reason; an op users wire *directly* (YAML/canvas) belongs in `ops/` with
  a category and group.
- **Do not add a discovery category to `FilterOp`/`WrappedOp`** — surfacing a raw-callable
  parameter on a canvas is a dead widget; the taxonomy is pinned in `tests/test_categories.py`.

## 6. Every knob is a DECLARED parameter — the `Enable` toggle (2026-07-27)

### Context

`Enable` gates an inner ops list behind one boolean. Its original design leaned on Confluid's
post-construction paradigm: **any** boolean attribute set on the instance was the toggle, and that
attribute's NAME became the CLI flag — `visualize: false` in YAML produced `--visualize`, and a
`name:` was only needed to disambiguate two wrappers. Nothing about the toggle was declared; it
existed purely as a runtime attribute Confluid setattr'd from an unrecognised YAML key.

That works for exactly one front-end — hand-written YAML — because only the YAML loader has a
channel for undeclared keys. Every other caller reads the *signature*:

- `to_pydantic(Enable).model_fields` returned `['ops']`, so a schema/form/canvas generator built a
  node with no toggle at all — the wrapper rendered as a pass-through and then raised at runtime.
- `Enable(ops=[...], visualize=True)` raised `ValidationError: Extra inputs are not permitted`
  (the generated config model forbids extras), so neither Python nor a generated tool call could
  construct a toggled wrapper — the only spelling was construct-then-setattr.
- `confluid.accepts_key(Enable, "visualize")` was `False`, so liquifai *silently dropped* the bare
  broadcast the docstring advertised (`--visualize true`). Only `--<name>.<toggle>` landed, and
  only via the addressed branch's "the key is already in the YAML kwargs" escape hatch.

A knob that only YAML can reach is a knob three of the four front-ends cannot offer.

### Decision

The toggle is a **declared, defaulted constructor parameter** — `enabled: bool = True` — exposed as
a **settable property**, and instance identity is the **declared `name`**, which scopes the flag to
`--<name>.enabled`. Dynamic toggle naming is retired.

A property rather than a plain attribute for two reasons: `confluid.accepts_key` admits "public
settable class attributes", so the property keeps `enabled` overridable independently of the
signature; and it gives ONE funnel to reject a non-bool, so a quoted YAML `enabled: "true"` fails
at its `file:line` instead of being silently truthy.

The retired form is not silently ignored: a stray public boolean attribute (what `visualize: false`
now lands as) raises on first record with the replacement spelling in the message.

### Consequences

- One declaration serves every front-end: YAML key, `--enabled` / `--<name>.enabled` override,
  Python kwarg, generated tool/form schema, canvas widget. No front-end-specific glue.
- The generalisable rule: **if a front-end must set it, declare it.** A value that only ever
  arrives via post-construction setattr is reachable from YAML alone.
- Breaking change: `visualize: false` (and any other dynamic toggle name) must become
  `name: visualize` + `enabled: false`; the CLI flag becomes `--visualize.enabled`.
- `flag_name` is gone — with a fixed toggle name there is nothing to introspect.
- Strictness is deliberate: `enabled` accepts only `bool`. Every CLI form already delivers a real
  bool (`--enabled true`, `--enabled=false`, `--enabled+`, `enabled=true`), so the rejection only
  catches genuinely ambiguous config.

### Example

```yaml
- !class:recordstream.ops.enable.Enable
  name: visualize
  enabled: false
  ops: [ !class:recordstream.ops.image.ConvertToImage {} ]
```

```bash
recordstream run pipeline.yaml --visualize.enabled true   # addressed: this wrapper
recordstream run pipeline.yaml --enabled false            # broadcast: every wrapper
```

```python
op = Enable(ops=[convert], name="visualize", enabled=False)   # one call — no setattr step
op.enabled = True                                             # property setter; non-bool raises

to_pydantic(Enable).model_fields           # {'ops', 'enabled', 'name'} — the schema surface
accepts_broadcast(Enable, "enabled")       # True — the bare --enabled form now lands
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Adding a knob to any op**: declare it in `__init__` with a default and an `Args:` line. Reach
  for post-construction setattr only for values a *config layer* injects, never for a user-facing
  switch. Usage lives in the project README (`Toggling a branch from the CLI`).
- **Distinguishing instances**: use `name:` — Confluid reads it for hierarchy labelling and
  liquifai for `--<name>.<key>` addressing. Do not invent a per-class flag vocabulary; that was
  the retired design.
- **More than one switch in a chain**: use several `Enable` wrappers with distinct names rather
  than teaching one wrapper several toggles — each name is independently addressable, and the
  broadcast form still flips them all.

### Amendment: a DERIVED value is a knob nobody can reach either (2026-08-22)

`loader_slots` derived `persistent_workers` from `num_workers` (`!= 0`) and its docstring said
there was "deliberately no separate knob, because the pairing never varies". The pairing does vary,
along an axis the derivation cannot see: macOS terminates persistent workers slowly enough that a
short run spends longer stopping than training, so a config there wants workers WITHOUT persistence.
Reaching that meant replacing all three loader slots wholesale — twelve YAML lines that also had to
restate `collate_fn`, because a replaced slot loses the code default and torch's `default_collate`
then crashes on string metadata.

The reason a plain top-level key was not enough is worth stating, because the neighbouring case
looks identical and behaves differently: a flat config key DOES reach these code-created markers by
broadcasting — `multiprocessing_context: fork` lands in all three slots with no parameter anywhere
(measured) — but only for a kwarg the marker does not already carry. `persistent_workers` is BAKED
here at construction, so there was nothing for a config to reach.

The rule above answers it unchanged: **if a front-end must set it, declare it.** The parameter is
`persistent_workers: Optional[bool] = None` — `None` derives exactly as before (so nothing that
does not pass it changes), an explicit value wins, and `True` with `num_workers=0` raises at
construction rather than inside torch at first iteration, which is the one invariant the
derived-only version had protected by construction. The same parameter is declared by every
consuming runnable, so it broadcasts from a flat config like `batch_size` does.

The generalisation for the next time: deriving a value is not a way to avoid declaring it. A
derivation is a good DEFAULT and a bad ONLY option — the moment one caller knows something the
derivation cannot, the undeclared value costs a wholesale replacement of the object that holds it.

## 7. The `@entrypoint` markers ARE the dispatch table (`run_entrypoint`, 2026-07-29)

### Context

A merged train+eval runnable exposes several capabilities from ONE class and selects between them
with a single `task` knob. Two readers need to know the task→capability mapping: the runnable's own
`run()`, which must call the right method, and a discovery consumer (a config generator, a visual
editor), which must know that one class both trains and evaluates and which `task` value means
"evaluate". The `@entrypoint(task, role, primary)` marker was introduced for the second reader only;
`run()` carried its own copy:

```python
dispatch = {"fit": self.fit, "evaluate": self.evaluate, "test": self.test, "predict": self.predict}
```

So every merged runnable stated the same mapping twice — once in the decorators, once in the dict —
and three consumer packages carried that same five-line block verbatim. The two copies drift in a
direction that bites: a config generator pins `task:` from `entrypoint_tasks` (the markers), so a
capability added to the markers and forgotten in the dict yields a *generated* config that dies at
dispatch with "unknown task" while discovery advertises it as supported. Nothing could catch that —
the dict is not derived from anything, so no test can compare it to a source of truth.

### Decision

The markers are the ONE table, and `run_entrypoint(runnable, task)` is their runtime half: it builds
`{declared task: method name}` from `runnable_entrypoints(type(runnable))`, calls the match, and
raises `ValueError` on an unknown task listing the declared ones in declaration order. A merged
runnable's `run()` is then `run_entrypoint(self, self.task)` — the decorators are the only place the
mapping exists.

The lookup reads markers off raw function objects via `vars()` (as `runnable_entrypoints` already
did), so a dynamic `__needs_autograd__` property never fires during dispatch.

### Consequences

- Adding a capability is ONE edit: decorate a method. Discovery and dispatch cannot disagree,
  because they read the same annotations.
- The error message doubles as the class's capability list, in declaration order rather than the
  sorted order a set would give.
- What is lost: the dict form let a type checker verify `self.fit` exists; `getattr(self, name)()`
  is `Any`. Cheap here — the methods are decorated in the same file, and a wrong name would have to
  survive its own `@entrypoint` line.
- Cost is one MRO walk per `run()` — once per training run.
- The markers are now load-bearing at RUNTIME, not just for discovery: dropping an `@entrypoint`
  breaks the run, where before it only emptied a picker. That is the intended direction (a silent
  discovery gap becomes a loud dispatch failure), but it means the decorators are no longer
  optional metadata for a class that dispatches this way.

### Example

```python
from recordstream import TorchRunner, entrypoint, run_entrypoint

class Classifier(TorchRunner):
    def __init__(self, task: str = "fit") -> None:
        self.task = task

    def run(self) -> None:
        run_entrypoint(self, self.task)          # no second copy of the mapping

    @entrypoint("fit", role="trainer", primary=True)
    def fit(self) -> None: ...

    @entrypoint("test", role="evaluator", primary=True)
    def test(self) -> None: ...
```

```python
>>> Classifier(task="test").run()          # calls Classifier.test()
>>> Classifier(task="export").run()
ValueError: Unknown task 'export'; expected one of ['fit', 'test'].
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Adding a capability**: decorate the method with `@entrypoint("<task>", role=..., primary=...)`
  and extend the runnable's own `task` Literal. Nothing else — usage lives in `docs/runnable.md`.
- **A capability that is NOT config-selectable**: leave it undecorated and call it directly; the
  marker means "reachable through `task:`", so decorating a helper would advertise it to config
  generators as a runnable capability.
- **A different dispatch policy** (aliases, a default task, a per-role default): build it on top of
  `runnable_entrypoints` rather than beside it — the invariant to preserve is that the markers stay
  the only place the mapping is written down.

## 8. The autograd marker is named for the framework; its FLAG for what it decides (2026-07-29)

### Context

`TorchRunner` exists so a GUI executor — which evaluates graph nodes under
`torch.inference_mode()` for cheap, grad-free runs — can tell "this run does gradient descent"
from "this run is inference-only" and re-enable autograd around the former. The mixin set a flag
named after ITSELF, `__torch_runner__`, and that name answers a question nobody asks at the one
place it is read:

```python
torch_runner = bool(getattr(runnable, "__torch_runner__", False))   # "is this a torch runner?"
```

Every runnable in this workspace is a torch runnable, so read literally the flag is always true —
yet it is deliberately false for an evaluator, and the merged train+eval runnables override it as
a per-task property whose body (`return self.task == "fit"`) contradicts its own name: predicting
with a torch model does not stop the object from being "a torch runner". The name described the
declaring class instead of the decision the reader makes with it.

### Decision

Keep the CLASS name (`TorchRunner` — autograd is a torch concept, and a non-torch backend would
not inherit this mixin at all), rename the FLAG to **`__needs_autograd__`**. The two names then
answer different questions on purpose: which framework's execution mode is at stake, and whether
this particular run needs gradients.

No compatibility alias. The flag is a duck-typed contract with exactly one reader, so the rename
lands in both packages at once — consistent with the workspace's no-back-compat precedent.

### Consequences

- The dynamic per-task override reads as what it means, which is where the old name hurt most.
- **The read fails OPEN** (`getattr(runnable, "__needs_autograd__", False)`): a reader left on the
  old name sees `False` for every runnable and silently executes training under `inference_mode`
  until `loss.backward()` raises *"element 0 of tensors does not require grad"*. That is why the
  rename is all-or-nothing across the reader and the declarer — never a partial rollout.
- An external duck-typed implementer (an object that sets the flag without inheriting the mixin)
  must be updated by hand; there is no import to break and therefore no compile-time signal.

### Example

```python
class TorchRunner:
    __needs_autograd__: bool = True          # inherited by trainers and workflow combinators


class Classifier(TorchRunner, L.LightningModule):
    @property
    def __needs_autograd__(self) -> bool:    # type: ignore[override]
        """Only ``fit`` needs autograd; evaluate / test / predict are inference-only."""
        return self.task == "fit"
```

```python
# the executor side (one reader, no import of this package)
if getattr(runnable, "__needs_autograd__", False):
    with torch.inference_mode(False), torch.enable_grad():
        runnable.run()
else:
    runnable.run()
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **A runnable that never trains**: do not inherit `TorchRunner` at all — the absent flag is the
  statement. Usage lives in `docs/runnable.md`.
- **A runnable that sometimes trains**: override `__needs_autograd__` as a property, as above.
- **Another execution-mode marker** (a "needs a GPU", "must run single-process" flag): follow the
  same rule — name the class for the concern, the flag for the decision the executor makes, and
  remember that a duck-typed read of a missing flag is silent.

## 8. The model boundary belongs to the package that reads it (2026-07-29)

### Context

Four surfaces used to live in the workspace's experiment-**tracking** library: a dataset
normalizer (`ensure_record_dataset`), the prediction-output contracts (`ClassificationOutput` &
co) with their torch builders, a predictions sink (`PredictionsSink` +
`ClassificationPredictionsSink`), and class-imbalance weighting (`apply_class_weights` and its
inverse-frequency arithmetic).

None of them tracked anything. The normalizer's whole body was "already a `Stream`? else wrap in
one". The sink's own module docstring justified its placement circularly — it lived there
*because the contract and the output type lived there* — while its body was record plumbing plus a
numpy `argsort`, threading its result through recordstream ops. And the sink advertised itself as
modality-neutral while building its diagnostics from `pack_id` / `iq_file` /
`window_start_sample`: signal-domain keys, in a class a tabular classifier was supposed to reuse.

The pattern underneath: each of these describes a boundary whose only READER is elsewhere, and a
contract that outlives its reader accumulates justifications instead of users.

### Decision

A package owns a contract when it owns the reader. So:

- `ensure_record_dataset` / `RecordSource` land beside `Stream` — the only type they know.
- `recordstream.outputs` holds the contracts *and* their torch builders, because
  `recordstream.predictions` — the sink that reads `probs` by name — is right next to it.
- `recordstream.predictions` holds the sink and the `PredictionsSink` protocol.
- `class_counts` / `inverse_frequency_weights` land beside `LabelMap`, because how often each
  class occurs is a statistic over the labels.

The line is drawn at the *framework convention*, not at "does this import torch" (this package
already hard-depends on torch — a `Stream` IS a `torch.utils.data.Dataset`). What did NOT move:
whether a loss accepts a `weight` argument and how to inject it. That is `torch.nn`'s constructor
convention — Keras takes `class_weight` on `fit()` — so it lives in the consuming runnable as an
overridable method, and this package never learns what a loss is.

### Consequences

- The weights come back as **numpy**, matching `recordstream.batch` (only `batch_tensor` is
  torch). A torch caller writes `torch.as_tensor(w)`; a Keras backend feeds the same array to
  `fit(class_weight=…)`. One statistic, no framework baked in.
- `inverse_frequency_weights` absorbed the `LabelMap.to_ids` flattening consumers used to write by
  hand, so a multi-label target counts for every class it names with no call-site branch.
- The engine's own rules bit immediately and usefully: the package-wide zero-arg-construction
  sweep failed on the imported sink (`ops` was a required constructor argument), so the check
  moved to `write()` where it belongs. Stricter host, better tenant.
- Two sink protocols now coexist (`DataSink.write(record)` vs
  `PredictionsSink.write(prediction, metadata)`). That is deliberate — a model emits a batch while
  the sink contract is per-record, so the halves arrive separately — and load-bearing downstream,
  where a visual editor's node palette keys off the distinction. Collapsing them is filed in
  `TASKS.md` rather than left to drift.
- No back-compat aliases: a stale import from the old location fails loudly.

### Example

```python
# a trainer, walking its targets exactly once and reusing that pass three ways
targets = self._walk_targets(self.train_set)          # ONE pass
self.label_map = LabelMap.fit(targets)                # (1) the encoding
num_classes = self.label_map.num_classes              # (2) the head size
weights = inverse_frequency_weights(targets, num_classes, self.label_map)   # (3) the balance

if weights is not None:
    self.apply_class_weights(weights)                 # framework hook — torch: loss.weight = ...
```

```python
# the boundary on the way out
def predict_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
    out = classification_output(self(x))              # recordstream.outputs
    self.predictions_sink.write(out, metadata)        # recordstream.predictions
    return out
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **A new prediction contract**: add it to `recordstream.outputs`, generic in the array type, and
  give it a builder only if the payload is DERIVED (logits → probs). A payload the model hands you
  directly (boxes) gets no builder. Usage lives in `docs/predictions.md`.
- **Another task's predictions sink**: implement `PredictionsSink` beside the classification one,
  or in the domain package when it needs domain geometry (a detector's back-projection to
  time/frequency does).
- **A different balancing policy** (effective-number, sqrt-inverse): add it beside
  `inverse_frequency_weights` in `recordstream.labels` as another statistic returning numpy. Do
  NOT add the injection here — that stays a per-backend method on the runnable.

---

## 9. torch is an extra; the engine is numpy (2026-07-30)

### Context

`recordstream` declared `torch` as a hard dependency, so `import recordstream` imported ~2GB of
PyTorch — and every package built on it inherited that transitively, declaring no torch of its
own. That was fine
while every consumer was a Lightning trainer. It stopped being fine when a second training engine
landed: a Keras-on-TensorFlow install, or a plain-numpy dataset-conversion job, paid for a
framework it never called.

Auditing what actually needed torch found the coupling was almost entirely nominal:

- **`Stream` and `FlowGraph` subclassed `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.** This was the expensive
  line, and it bought nothing. `Dataset` is an empty base — `DataLoader` duck-types its argument,
  needing only `__len__` and `__getitem__` (verified against a plain class with those two
  methods and no base). Nothing in the workspace does `isinstance(x, Dataset)`, and nothing
  subclasses `Stream`.
- **`storage/base.py` and `ops/image.py` imported torch for `isinstance(x, torch.Tensor)` alone** —
  to decide whether a payload needed `.detach().cpu().numpy()` before being written or rendered.
- Only `ops/torch.py` (`ToTensor`) and `outputs.py`'s `softmax`/`argmax` builders genuinely
  compute with it.

The two isinstance sites are the interesting case, because the naive fix — a lazy in-function
`import torch` — still *imports torch* the first time a record is written.

### Decision

**`torch` moved from `dependencies` to `[project.optional-dependencies] torch`, and the core
imports no framework.** Four mechanisms, one per coupling:

1. **The `Dataset` base is dropped** in favour of a `MapStyle` Protocol (`__len__` +
   `__getitem__`) — the engine still *says* "map-style dataset" in its own vocabulary, and
   `RecordSource = Union[MapStyle, Iterable[Record]]` stays the contract `ensure_record_dataset`
   enforces.
2. **Type identity without an import**: `recordstream._compat.is_torch_tensor` consults
   `sys.modules` rather than importing. This is exact, not a heuristic — *a torch tensor cannot
   exist in a process that has not imported torch*, so the absence of the module proves the
   negative. It is the same instinct as the op-family matchers, which identify an albumentations
   or torchvision transform by its MRO module name.
3. **`ToTensor` is a lazy export** — `recordstream.ops` maps it in `_OPTIONAL_OPS` and resolves it
   in a PEP 562 module `__getattr__`, raising an `ImportError` that names the extra instead of a
   traceback from three libraries down. `__dir__` still advertises it so completion works.
4. **`outputs.py` splits by what needs a runtime**: the `TypedDict` contracts stay module-level
   (they are typing-only, and generic in the array type), while `classification_output` /
   `segmentation_output` import torch in the function body — they are the only part that computes.

### Consequences

- **`DataLoader(stream)` now needs `cast(Any, stream)` in type-checked code.** torch's *stub*
  declares `Dataset[T]`; the runtime accepts any map-style object. This is a stub's stricter view
  of a contract that works, and the bridge belongs at the four call sites (all in tests) rather
  than in the engine — re-adding the base to satisfy a stub would restore the 2GB dependency to
  silence a type checker.
- **`MapStyle` must be referenced as the real class in any annotation a consumer introspects, never
  a string forward-ref.** confluid evaluates annotations in the *consumer's* namespace, so
  `RecordSource = Union["MapStyle", ...]` raised `NameError: name 'MapStyle' is not defined` from
  a consumer's `__init__` scan, three packages away.
- **The numpy-return rule elsewhere is now load-bearing, not stylistic.** `batch_values`,
  `multi_hot`, `batch_metadata` and the class-balance statistics return numpy precisely so this
  boundary holds; only `batch_tensor` is torch.
- **`recordstream.ops.torch` cannot be eagerly imported by anything in the package** — a new
  convenience re-export there would silently undo all of the above.

### Example

```python
# storage/base.py — recognise a tensor without importing torch
from recordstream._compat import is_torch_tensor

def to_numpy(data):
    return data.detach().cpu().numpy() if is_torch_tensor(data) else np.asarray(data)
```

```python
# recordstream/ops/__init__.py — the op is reachable, the import is not eager
_OPTIONAL_OPS = {"ToTensor": ("recordstream.ops.torch", "torch")}

def __getattr__(name):
    entry = _OPTIONAL_OPS.get(name)
    if entry is None:
        raise AttributeError(f"module {__name__!r} has no attribute {name!r}")
    module_path, extra = entry
    try:
        return getattr(importlib.import_module(module_path), name)
    except ImportError as exc:
        raise ImportError(f"recordstream.ops.{name} needs the {extra!r} extra: "
                          f"pip install 'recordstream[{extra}]'") from exc
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Add another optional-framework op**: put it in its own module, add one `_OPTIONAL_OPS` entry
  and one `__all__` entry, and declare the extra in `pyproject.toml`. No other edit — the error
  message and `dir()` follow from the mapping.
- **Recognise another framework's tensor type** (a TF tensor, a jax array): add a sibling to
  `_compat.py` using the same `sys.modules` rule. Do not add a module-level import of that
  framework anywhere in the core.
- **Need a torch-typed return from an existing helper**: add a `dtype=`/`device=` parameter and
  keep the numpy default, as `batch_tensor` does — do not change an existing numpy return, or the
  next backend has to reimplement it.
- **Installation** is documented in the README's Installation section; what each extra provides
  is the `pyproject.toml` comment beside it.

## 10. The framework's batching half lives beside the collate (`recordstream.keras`, 2026-07-30)

### Context

Batching a record source has two halves: **what one batch contains** (recordstream's
`collate_records`) and **which rows go in which batch** (the row order, the slicing, the short
final batch, the per-epoch reshuffle). For torch, the second half is free — a `DataLoader` does it,
duck-typing any `MapStyle` source (§9) and taking `collate_fn=collate_records` for the first half.
So recordstream shipped only half of the pair, and nobody noticed the other half was missing.

Keras 3 has no `DataLoader`. `keras.utils.PyDataset.__getitem__` must return a whole BATCH, so a
consumer has to write that loop itself. The first one did, in a training project — a
`RecordSequence(keras.utils.PyDataset)` inside an image classifier — and the result read as if the
adapter were part of the task. It was not: sixty percent of it (row order, `np.arange`, the rng,
`on_epoch_end`, `collate_records([source[i] for i in rows])`) mentioned nothing about
classification, while its torch twin in the same project was a single
`LazyClass(DataLoader, shuffle=True, collate_fn=collate_records)` line. A second Keras consumer
would have copied the file.

### Decision

**`recordstream.keras.RecordSequence` owns the DataLoader half; the consumer passes the batch
shape in.** The split is drawn exactly where torch draws it: `transform` is the `collate_fn`
equivalent, a callable mapping one collated record to what the model consumes. With no
`transform`, `__getitem__` hands over the batched record — the identity, which is also what
`batches()` yields for pairing per-record predictions with per-record metadata.

The module also owns the **`KERAS_BACKEND` ordering**, which is why it exists as one module rather
than a class dropped somewhere. Keras 3 reads that variable at import time and defaults to
`tensorflow`, which `recordstream[keras]` does not install (Keras is an API; the compute engine is
the operator's choice), so a bare `import keras` dies inside `keras.src.tree.optree_impl` with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'`. A `setdefault` to the first backend actually
present — probed with `find_spec`, so nothing is imported just to look — has to run in the LOWEST
layer that imports keras: import sorters put a library import above a first-party one, so a
consumer's own shim sorts BELOW `from recordstream.keras import RecordSequence` and would lose the
race.

### Consequences

- **`RecordSequence` is absent from the package root, deliberately.** `inspect.getmembers` — what
  `discovery.scan_module` and the GUI bridges call — getattrs every name a module advertises, so a
  PEP 562 lazy export at the root (the `recordstream.ops.ToTensor` pattern) would import keras on
  every discovery scan of a torch-only install. The import path is the boundary marker:
  `from recordstream.keras import RecordSequence`.
- **It is not `@configurable` and carries no discovery `category`.** It is engine plumbing a
  runnable builds in code, like `collate_records`; tagging it would put a keras import in the
  registry scan for a class no YAML wires.
- **The row order is a lazy `@property`, not constructor state.** `len(source)` is real work for a
  deferred source (a `HuggingFaceSource` LOADS its dataset to answer it), and recordstream
  constructors do none — so `RecordSequence()` builds zero-arg and a missing `source` is reported
  by `indices` with a clear message.
- **A consumer's keras imports now route through recordstream.** A training project keeps its own
  one-line shim for spelling, but the ordering rule has one home; a project that imports keras
  ahead of `recordstream.keras` reintroduces the TensorFlow failure.
- **The extra names no compute engine.** `keras = ["keras>=3.0"]` only; torch/TF/jax come from
  whichever consumer extra selected one, and `_first_installed_backend` adapts to what is there.

### Example

```python
# The consumer supplies the SHAPE; the engine supplies the batching.
from recordstream.keras import RecordSequence

def to_xy(batch):                                    # the classification decision, 3 lines
    x = np.asarray(batch_values(batch, "image"), dtype="float32")
    return x, np.asarray(batch_values(batch, "class"), dtype="int64")

seq = RecordSequence(stream, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, transform=to_xy)
model.fit(seq, epochs=3)

# ...and the torch twin, for the symmetry this restores:
loader = DataLoader(cast(Any, stream), batch_size=32, shuffle=True, collate_fn=collate_records)
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Add another framework's batching adapter** (a JAX/`grain` sampler, a TF `tf.data` generator):
  a sibling module behind its own extra, same split — the engine owns row order + collate, the
  caller owns the batch shape via a `transform`-shaped parameter. Do not grow `RecordSequence` a
  framework switch.
- **`PyDataset`'s prefetch knobs are already declared** (`workers` / `use_multiprocessing` /
  `max_queue_size`, forwarded to `super().__init__()` at Keras's own defaults). Any further
  passthrough follows the same rule — a named, defaulted, `Args:`-documented parameter, never a
  `**kwargs` escape hatch, per the declared-parameter mandate (§6). Pinned by
  `test_every_knob_is_a_declared_parameter`.
- **Usage** is [docs/kinds.md](kinds.md#keras-recordsequence--the-batching-half-the-framework-leaves-to-you);
  what the extra provides is the `pyproject.toml` comment beside it.

## 11. Sources are a package, one class per module — and the module path is the contract (2026-08-01)

### Context

`recordstream/sources.py` had grown to four unrelated `@configurable` classes in 511 lines: a
concrete loader (`HuggingFaceSource`, which reaches the network) and three pure view sources that
only do index arithmetic (`DatasetSplit`, `RangeSource`, `ConcatSource`). Nothing tied them
together beyond the word "source" — editing the HF metadata resolution meant scrolling past the
split partitioner, and a reader looking for the concat offsets had to know it was the last class
in the file. `recordstream.ops` had already been a package for exactly this reason.

The split is not free, because in this workspace a class's **module path is a published
contract**. `confluid.pydantic_export._qualname` builds it as `f"{cls.__module__}.{cls.__qualname__}"`,
and that string is what a generated config emits as its `!class:` tag, what a form-spec / MCP
schema reports, and what keys the discovery-service enrichment table. Moving a class to a
submodule therefore changes the tag every generator writes.

### Decision

**One class per module under `recordstream/sources/`, and the submodule path is canonical.**
`huggingface.py` / `split.py` / `range.py` / `concat.py`, plus a `base.py` holding the one helper
the three view sources share. `__init__.py` re-exports every public name so
`from recordstream.sources import DatasetSplit` is unchanged.

The alternative — pinning `__module__` back to `recordstream.sources` in `__init__.py` so no
downstream string moves — was measured and rejected. It breaks
`confluid.registry.key_for()`: `_entry_for_object` finds an entry by recomputing
`f"{cls.__module__}.{cls.__qualname__}"` and comparing against the key stored when
`@configurable` ran, so a rewritten `__module__` misses. The fallout is silent — with a namesake
registered, a pinned class dumps the ambiguous `!class:Thing()` while an unpinned twin correctly
dumps its disambiguated `!class:__main__.Thing~2()`. It also breaks `inspect.getsource`, which
searches `__init__.py` and raises `OSError: could not find class definition`.

### Consequences

- **Both spellings still resolve.** `confluid.resolve_class` falls back to
  `importlib.import_module(module_path)` + `getattr`, and the package re-exports every name, so a
  hand-written `!class:recordstream.sources.HuggingFaceSource` in an old config keeps loading.
  What *changed* is what generators WRITE, so every such string in the workspace was updated in
  the same change — including the discovery-service enrichment key, whose miss would have silently
  dropped a field alias rather than failing.
- **`__init__.py`'s `__all__` became load-bearing.** `recordstream.discovery.scan_module` filters
  members on `member.__module__ == mod_name`, so it now returns `[]` for the package. A visual
  editor's node bridge survives only through its second pass, which walks `__all__` — verified by
  running that bridge before and after and diffing the registered node keys (identical).
- **One entry point for the package, not one per submodule.** Unlike `recordstream.ops.*`, where
  each module is entry-pointed, `recordstream/sources/__init__.py` imports all four submodules, so
  importing the package registers every `@configurable`. Adding per-submodule entry points would
  only re-scan the same classes.
- **A new source is a new file.** There is no longer a "where in the file" question, and a source
  that needs a heavy import keeps it out of its siblings' import path.

### Example

```yaml
# canonical — what a generator emits, matching cls.__module__
train_set: !class:recordstream.sources.huggingface.HuggingFaceSource
  path: ylecun/mnist
  split: train

my_split: !class:recordstream.sources.split.DatasetSplit()
  source: !ref:train_set
  val_fraction: 0.1
  seed: 42
```

```python
# the import surface is the package, unchanged by the split
from recordstream.sources import ConcatSource, DatasetSplit, HuggingFaceSource, RangeSource
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Add a source**: one new module under `recordstream/sources/`, its class re-exported from
  `__init__.py` AND listed in `__all__` — the second half is what puts it in a visual editor's
  palette, and forgetting it fails silently.
- **Share code between view sources**: `base.py`. It is private to the package; a helper a
  consumer should call belongs at the package root instead.
- **Usage** is [docs/sources.md](sources.md).

## 12. `core` and `flow` are packages too — layered by import direction (2026-08-01)

### Context

`core.py` was 713 lines holding four unrelated things: the op-family registry and the
`_apply_op` chokepoint, the `MapStyle` Protocol, the two fluent-API callable wrappers, and the
`Stream` engine. `flow.py` was 708: the step model, the document parser, the per-record kernel,
and `FlowGraph`. Both had crossed the line where a reader looking for one thing scrolls past
three others — the same threshold that made `sources.py` a package (§11).

Unlike `sources.py`, neither file is class-dominated: roughly 45% of `core.py` was free
functions. A literal one-class-per-module rule would have produced a 30-line `joint_stream.py`
and two ~35-line wrapper modules, which §5 had already considered and rejected as "structure for
structure's sake". And the split had to preserve something load-bearing: §5's whole argument is
that `core` is the BOTTOM of the op-facing layer, so a naive split risked closing the very
import cycle that record exists to prevent.

### Decision

**One module per cohesive unit, layered so imports run strictly one way.** A class gets its own
module when it dominates one (`Stream`, `FlowGraph`); otherwise the unit is the boundary.

    core/    families.py  → mapstyle.py → wrappers.py → stream.py
    flow/    steps.py     → parse.py    → execute.py  → graph.py

`core/families.py` is the bottom: the registry, the built-in families, `_apply_op`, and the
`EXPANDS` protocol — everything about applying ONE op to ONE record, importing nothing from its
siblings. `flow/execute.py` imports it directly, which is what keeps `flow` from reaching back
into `core.stream`; `core.stream` reaches `flow` only through body-local imports, exactly as
`core.py` did.

Three functions sit where their DEPENDENCY puts them rather than where their name suggests:
`ensure_record_dataset` is in `stream.py` (its whole body builds a `Stream`, and putting it in
`mapstyle.py` beside the `RecordSource` type it consumes would have made a pure type module
import the engine); `linear_steps` and `_worker_task` likewise, because both compile or run an
ops LIST, which is `Stream`'s spelling of a pipeline.

### Consequences

- **The canonical `!class:` path moved** — `recordstream.core.stream.Stream`,
  `recordstream.core.wrappers.FilterOp`, `recordstream.flow.graph.FlowGraph`. The package
  spelling still resolves (§11), so hand-written configs keep loading, but generators emit the
  new one, so all 64 downstream files were updated in the same change.
- **A monkeypatch must now name the module that USES a symbol, not the one that defines it.**
  This is the one behaviour change with teeth. `flow/graph.py` does
  `from recordstream.flow.execute import _result_readers`, which BINDS the name — so patching
  `recordstream.flow` (which worked when both lived in one module) silently misses. The suite
  caught it immediately; a test that had been asserting a performance property was suddenly
  asserting nothing. `recordstream/core/__init__.py` carries a note saying so.
- **`_OP_FAMILIES` is the exception, and only because it is mutable.** The registry list is
  re-exported by identity, so `core._OP_FAMILIES[:] = snapshot` still restores the real registry.
  Rebinding it (`core._OP_FAMILIES = []`) would not.
- **`core/__init__.py` re-exports PRIVATE names deliberately** (`_apply_op` and friends), marked
  `# noqa: F401`. They are the engine's internal cross-module surface — every composing op in
  `ops/` imports `_apply_op` from `recordstream.core` — so the package boundary has to carry them
  even though `__all__` (and therefore a visual editor's palette) must not.
- **`__all__` became load-bearing in both packages**, for the reason §11 gives. `core.py` had
  none at all, so `Stream` and `JointStream` reached the palette purely through
  `scan_module`'s `__module__` filter; after the split that pass returns `[]`. Verified by
  diffing the registered node keys before and after (identical).

### Example

```yaml
# canonical — what a generator emits, matching cls.__module__
train_set: !class:recordstream.core.stream.Stream()
  source: !ref:hf_train
  ops: !ref:preprocess
```

```python
# the import surface is the package, unchanged by the split
from recordstream.core import Stream, ensure_record_dataset
from recordstream.flow import FlowGraph, run_steps_multi

# ...but a test double names the USER of a symbol, not its definition:
monkeypatch.setattr(recordstream.flow.graph, "_result_readers", counting)   # ✓
monkeypatch.setattr(recordstream.flow, "_result_readers", counting)         # ✗ silently misses
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Add an engine-constructed helper**: `core/wrappers.py` if it wraps a raw callable, else the
  module whose layer it belongs to — never a new module above `stream.py`, which would invert the
  direction the layering protects (§5).
- **Add an op family**: `register_op_family` from anywhere; `core/families.py` only holds the
  built-ins, and they register through the same public API (§1).
- **Split `flow/execute.py` further** if a third route appears — but `is_linear` must stay the
  single gate, and the routes must keep agreeing record-for-record (§3).

## 13. Dataset identity is a protocol, and a view propagates it verbatim (`recordstream.uri`, 2026-08-02)

### Context

A source knew what it read; nothing else could ask. `HuggingFaceSource` logged
`Loading mnist (train)...` and stamped `hf_path` / `hf_split` onto every record, but both are
per-record payload — a consumer wanting to answer "which data produced this?" for the RUN had to
reach into a record, or reach into the source's constructor arguments and reassemble an
identifier by hand. Every such consumer reassembled it differently, so two answers to the same
question could not be compared.

What the question needs is one string per dataset that is stable across machines and across the
wrappers a config puts in front of a source — a trainer's `train_set` is typically a stream over
a split view over the real source, and all three read the same dataset.

### Decision

**A source may expose `dataset_uri` and `dataset_url`; free functions read them, and following
wrappers happens in the functions rather than in every wrapper.**

Two properties, because they answer different questions. `dataset_uri` is the CANONICAL handle
— machine-parseable, stable, the string two runs are compared on. `dataset_url` is a link a
person can open, and `None` whenever the data has no web page. Collapsing them would force a
choice between a browsable string that lies about local data and a canonical one nobody can
click.

`dataset_uri(source)` materializes a deferred source (as `project` does), reads the property,
and — when the object has none — follows a `.source` attribute and asks again, depth-capped and
cycle-safe. Every view source in this package uses that attribute name, so all of them work with
no code of their own, and so does any third-party wrapper that follows the convention.

**A wrapper propagates the URI unchanged.** Decorating it with the slice or the split the wrapper
applies was considered and rejected: the handle identifies the *dataset*, and how much of it a
run consumed is already recorded by the wrapper's own configuration. Decorating would mean one
dataset reached two ways no longer compares equal — the single property the handle exists to
have.

A source holding SEVERAL datasets (`ConcatSource`) answers `None` rather than picking a member;
`dataset_uris` is the plural form that fans out over them.

### Consequences

- **Asking is free and never loads.** The properties read stored configuration, so a tracking
  layer can identify a dataset that the run has not touched yet — and a source that is never
  iterated still names itself.
- **A new source needs one property, not a registration.** `SupportsDatasetIdentity` is a
  `Protocol`, so a domain package opts in by defining the members.
- **A consumer derives the classification from the URI, not from the source.** The scheme is the
  kind, the path is the name, a `split` parameter is the split — so a consumer recording datasets
  needs no knowledge of any particular source type, and a new source type needs no change there.
- **The query string is sorted.** Two identically-configured sources must produce one string;
  parameter order that depended on insertion would silently break comparison.
- **`None` is an ordinary answer**, not an error: an unconfigured source, a stream over an
  in-memory list, and data with no web page all legitimately have nothing to say.

### Example

```python
from recordstream import HuggingFaceSource, Stream, dataset_uri, dataset_uris, dataset_url

source = HuggingFaceSource(path="ylecun/mnist", split="train")
source.dataset_uri   # 'hf://datasets/ylecun/mnist?split=train'
source.dataset_url   # 'https://huggingface.co/datasets/ylecun/mnist/viewer/default/train'

# a view reports the same DATASET — the slice it takes is its own configuration, not identity
dataset_uri(Stream(source=RangeSource(source=source, stop=100)))
# 'hf://datasets/ylecun/mnist?split=train'

# several datasets end to end are not one dataset
dataset_uri(ConcatSource(sources=[a, b]))    # None
dataset_uris(ConcatSource(sources=[a, b]))   # ['hf://datasets/…', 'file:///…']
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Give a new source an identity**: add the two properties. Keep them cheap and side-effect free
  — they are asked of sources that may never be read.
- **Recognise a new wrapper shape**: `recordstream/uri.py` follows `.source`; a wrapper using a
  different attribute name implements the properties itself instead.
- **Usage** is [docs/sources.md](sources.md#identifying-a-dataset).

## 14. `Boxes` is pixel-only — the signal-domain region type moved out (2026-08-10)

### Context

The structured item was born as `Regions`, and its own docstring sanctioned TWO coordinate
systems in one field: pixel `[x0, y0, x1, y1]` rows on an image raster, or signal
`[f0, f1, t0, t1]` rows in time/frequency. Nothing on the item said which one a given
instance held — consumers disambiguated by record key and by which op produced the value.
Every mechanical consumer in this package (the detection target ops, `ResizeDetection`'s
scaling, the three geometry-desync guards, `canvas` itself — an `(H, W)` raster) assumed the
pixel reading; a `Regions` carrying signal coordinates satisfied `isinstance` checks written
for a contract it did not hold. A third convention hid inside the same type:
`connected_component_bboxes` emitted INCLUSIVE `(row_min, row_max, col_min, col_max)` bin
tuples, axis-swapped from every other producer, reconciled by a transpose at exactly one
call site.

### Decision

The item is **`Boxes`**, and it is **pixel-only**: half-open absolute-pixel
`[x0, y0, x1, y1]` rows (x rightward, y downward), `labels`/`scores`, the `(H, W)` `canvas`
frame, per-box `extras`. A domain package needing a different coordinate system registers its
OWN item through the SAME open `register_item` registry — exactly the modality-neutrality
story the item registry exists for; this engine keeps zero knowledge of it.
`connected_component_boxes` (renamed WITH its contract, so stale callers break loudly) now
emits the same half-open xyxy convention, `ConnectedComponents` fills `canvas` in (empty
masks included), and the one reconciling transpose in `masks_to_detection` is gone. There is
NO back-compat alias in either direction (the workspace rename convention): a stored
`typedrecord-v1` record carrying `__item_type__: "Regions"` fails loudly on decode and is
re-generated with a current sink.

### Consequences

- One name, one convention: `isinstance(value, Boxes)` now implies the pixel contract the
  geometry guards and detection consumers were already assuming.
- The guards correctly go SILENT for a domain package's region item — physical-unit
  coordinates are raster-independent, so "the pixels moved and the boxes did not" was a false
  alarm for them all along.
- Every `Boxes` producer emits the same row shape; the `+1`/transpose fix-ups that existed
  only to bridge `connected_component_bboxes`' divergent order are deleted rather than moved.
- Stored datasets from before the rename must be re-generated (loud `KeyError`/`TypeError` on
  decode — the established `typedrecord-v1` no-back-compat rule).

### Example

```python
from recordstream import Boxes, Mask
from recordstream.ops.numpy import ConnectedComponents

out = ConnectedComponents()({"mask": Mask(mask_2d)})
out["boxes"]            # Boxes(boxes=[(x0, y0, x1, y1), ...], canvas=mask_2d.shape)
mask_2d[y0:y1, x0:x1]   # half-open: covers the component exactly
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Add a new pixel-box producer**: emit half-open xyxy and FILL `canvas` in (the
  metadata-on-the-value mandate); the pins live in `tests/test_typed_generic_ops.py`.
- **A new coordinate system** is a NEW registered item in the owning domain package, never a
  second meaning for `Boxes` — that is the mistake this record exists to prevent.
- **Usage** is [docs/record-model.md](record-model.md); the batch read-back is `batch_boxes`
  ([docs/kinds.md](kinds.md)).

## 15. A pipeline interface is a pass-through op, not a socket type (`RecordContract`, 2026-08-25)

### Context

A pipeline built in a visual editor (or authored as YAML) has an implicit contract with its
host: the records it delivers must carry certain entries with certain item types — a
classification consumer needs an `Image` under `image` and a `Label` under `class`. Nothing
stated that contract. A wrong graph loaded cleanly, exported cleanly, and failed only
downstream — as an empty review queue or a training run with no targets — far from the
place the mistake was made. Two alternative homes for the contract were considered: a typed
socket vocabulary in the editor (statically narrow the stream wire per record schema), and a
host-side check at apply time (peek a record after loading the document).

### Decision

The contract is an **op**: `recordstream.ops.contract.RecordContract`, a pass-through
`Record -> Record` callable that checks each record against a declared `fields` map
(record key → registered item type name, `"*"` = present with any type) and raises a
located `ContractError` on the first violation. **Position decides the role** — the first
op in a chain states what the host must feed (input contract), the last what the pipeline
guarantees (output contract) — so ONE class serves both boundaries and there is no `role`
knob. Socket-level typing was rejected because every op is a generic `Record -> Record`:
no static claim survives one op between source and boundary, so a socket schema would be
enforcement theater. A host-side-only check was rejected because it leaves the contract
invisible in the graph (nothing to see or edit) and unenforced when the exported document
runs elsewhere; as an op, the contract rides the document into every executor.

### Consequences

- The item registry is the type vocabulary (`get_item_type` / `item_type_names` — already
  documented as the enumerable socket-type vocabulary), so a domain package's registered
  item is contractable with zero core changes.
- The check runs on EVERY record (a dict lookup + `isinstance` per declared entry) — a
  violation names the exact record ordinal, not just "somewhere in the stream".
- A conversion that emits plain values (a live tensor) is expressible via `"*"` —
  presence-only, no item type demanded.
- A host that seeds a graph places a pre-configured contract node at the boundary; the
  editor's user sees the required shape before wiring the first node.

### Example

```python
from recordstream import Stream
from recordstream.ops.contract import RecordContract

stream = Stream(
    source=my_source,
    ops=[
        RecordContract(fields={"raw": "*"}, name="denoise input"),        # first = input contract
        wrap_raw_as_image,
        RecordContract(fields={"image": "Image"}, name="denoise output"),  # last = output guarantee
    ],
)
# a record without "raw" fails AT THE INPUT boundary:
# ContractError: denoise input: record #0 has no entry 'raw' (expected *); present: class[Label]
```

### What you may change (and where it's documented)

- **Add checks** (shape, dtype, value range) as new declared parameters on the op — never a
  second contract class per task.
- **Do not add a `role` parameter**: position already is the role, and a role knob would let
  a graph state one and mean the other.
- **Usage** is the README ("Stating a pipeline's interface"); pins live in
  `tests/test_contract.py` (incl. the input+output dual-position group).

## 16. An op declares its interface, and a chain is checked before it runs (`check_chain`, 2026-09-05)

**Context.** Record 15 put a pipeline's interface on the canvas as a pass-through op: you PLACE a
`RecordContract` at a boundary and it asserts. That answers *"what must reach here?"* and it is the
right shape for a boundary — but it does not answer *"does this chain hold together?"*, and that is
the question a chain of a dozen small ops actually raises.

The failure is silent, which is what makes it worth machinery. An op that reads a record entry an
earlier op was supposed to write does not raise: the key is simply absent, so the op returns the
record unchanged and the pipeline produces an empty result. In a consuming workspace that surfaces
as a blank pane with no error anywhere — the reader has nothing to go on, and the boundary contract
is no help, because the record crossing the boundary is fine.

**Decision.** An op MAY declare its interface as class attributes, and `check_chain(ops)` reads them
off the op list once, before the first record:

* `consumes` / `produces` — `{record key: registered item type}`, the SAME vocabulary
  `RecordContract.fields` uses, `"*"` for "present, any type";
* `reports` — the op's key in an analysis report (`""` marks a transform rather than an analysis);
* `flags` — the boolean findings it raises, with the instance parameter `requires` naming the one
  flag that gates an op.

Four things are refused, each of which would otherwise surface as an empty result: a `consumes` key
nothing earlier produces; a `requires` naming a flag no op declares, or one declared only later; two
ops declaring one flag; two ops reporting under one name.

Declaring is **opt-in**. An op with none of these attributes is checked for nothing, so every chain
written before the mechanism keeps working untouched — which also means a declaring op must not
depend on an undeclared op's output. That is a real limit, and the refusal says so: the fix is to
declare on the producer.

**Consequences.** A mis-wired chain fails at load with a located message naming the node and the key,
instead of running to completion and answering nothing. `flag_producers(ops)` is total over every
declared flag — exactly one producer per flag is what `check_chain` enforces — so "which node decided
this branch?" always has an answer, for a report and for a visual editor that wants to draw the gate
as a wire rather than a widget.

The cost is a second vocabulary beside `RecordContract`'s, describing the same kind of fact at a
different scale. They are deliberately kept in one spelling (`{key: item type}`) so a chain's boundary
contract stays computable from its ops — unsatisfied `consumes` IS the input contract, terminal
`produces` IS the output contract.

**Example.**

```python
class MeasureSymbolClock:
    consumes = {"signal": "Signal", "inst_freq": "InstFreq"}
    produces = {"symbol_clock": "SymbolClock"}
    reports  = "clock"
    flags    = ()

check_chain(ops, provided={"signal"}, where="view_bte.yaml")
# ChainContractError: view_bte.yaml: MeasureSymbolClock needs the record entry 'inst_freq',
# which nothing before it produces — MeasureInstantaneousFrequency produces it, but LATER in
# the chain — move it before MeasureSymbolClock
```

**What you may change.** Which failures are refused, and what a message says. What must hold: the
check is opt-in (an undeclaring op is checked for nothing), the vocabulary stays `RecordContract`'s,
a flag has exactly one producer, and the refusal is LOCATED — a reader must never have to guess
which node broke.

## 17. A file format may answer from its METADATA alone (`scan` + `scan_file`, 2026-09-10)

**Context.** The format registry asked a file exactly one question that costs anything:
`read` — decode it into a record. For the formats that pair a small metadata file with a large
data file, that is the expensive question, and it is not the one every consumer has. "Where was
each of these recordings made?", "how long is each one?", "which of them carry annotations?" are
answered entirely by the sidecar, and a consumer surveying a whole listing cannot afford a decode
per file to get there.

Measured on a real capture library: **499 ms** to open one capture against **0.03 ms** to read the
sidecar beside it. Over 1430 recordings that is twelve minutes versus half a second — the
difference between a survey that exists and one that does not.

The consumer cannot close that gap itself. It would have to know which files have sidecars, what
those sidecars are called, and how to read them — which is the format's knowledge, and the whole
reason the registry exists.

**Decision.** `FileFormat` gains an OPTIONAL capability, `scan(path) -> Record`: what this file's
metadata says, its sidecar or its header, never its payload. It returns an ordinary record with
the payload left out, so every op and graph downstream reads a scan exactly like a decode — which
is what lets a consumer run the SAME analysis chain over a survey as over a recording.
`scan_file(path, formats=None)` dispatches it: the first format claiming the path, in registry
order, with the same companion rule `ReadFile` follows.

Optional, and probed structurally — like the write capability the annotation sink dispatches. A
format that cannot answer cheaply (a raw IQ file whose samples ARE the file) simply does not
implement it.

**Consequences.** `scan_file` answers `None` — never a `read` — for a companion half, an unclaimed
file, and a claiming format with no `scan`. The absent fallback is the point: the caller asked the
cheap question because the expensive one was unaffordable at this scale, so quietly answering the
expensive one turns a survey of ten thousand files into a decode of ten thousand files. A `scan`
that RAISES is left to the caller, because whether one malformed sidecar skips or fails a survey
is the survey's decision, not the registry's. And a scanned record is honestly incomplete: its
payload is empty, so a consumer that needs samples must ask for them by name.

**Example.**

```python
from recordstream.formats import scan_file

for path in listing:                       # thousands of files
    record = scan_file(path)               # sidecar only — no payload decode
    if record is None:                     # a companion half, or a format that cannot answer
        continue
    where = record["signal"].extras.get("gps_latitude")
```

**What you may change.** Which formats implement it, and what a scanned record carries. What must
hold: `scan` never decodes a payload, the dispatcher never falls back to `read`, the companion rule
matches `ReadFile`'s, and the returned record stays an ordinary record so one chain serves both.

## 18. A view source forwards a key-restricted walk (`project_indices`, 2026-09-10)

**Context.** `projection.project(source, keys)` takes a source's own cheap walk only when the
object handed to it implements the protocol. Every view source here — `RangeSource`,
`ConcatSource`, `DatasetSplit`'s `_SplitView`, and `JointStream` — wraps a source without looking
inside a record, and none of them implemented it. So wrapping a projecting source in the thinnest
possible slice silently discarded its efficient path and fell back to reading every record whole.
Measured on a source whose records carry ~15 MB of samples, for the same records and the same
keys: 0.006 s per record straight from the source, 0.423 s through a `RangeSource` around it.

Forwarding is not simply `project(self.source, keys)`, because a view owns WHICH records and in
what ORDER, while the protocol is iterator-only — there is no "project index i". Two of the four
wrappers are a plain chain; the other two select by index, and one of those (a split) reorders.

**Decision.** `projection.project_indices(source, keys, indices)` is the shared primitive the
index wrappers call: it walks the source's own projection once, keeps the wanted positions, and
yields them in the order asked for. `ConcatSource` and `JointStream` chain `project` per part
instead — there is no index question there.

Laziness follows the ORDER, because that is the only thing that decides whether it can. Increasing
indices — a contiguous slice, an unshuffled split — stream straight through holding nothing. An
index arriving out of order is held until its turn, so a reordered view holds at most the records
between its own extremes, and what is held is a PROJECTED record: the entries asked for, never the
payload the projection exists to skip. That asymmetry is what keeps a shuffled view affordable
where materializing the source is not. The walk stops as soon as the last wanted index is
delivered, so a window at the front of a large source costs the front of it.

**Consequences.** A wrapper costs what the source under it costs — remeasured on the same corpus,
0.423 s → 0.004 s per record. A source without the protocol keeps the ordinary fallback, per part,
so nothing requires the protocol. What a `RangeSource` cannot avoid is walking the records before
`start`: it pays the projected cost for them rather than a full read, which is the honest limit of
an iterator-shaped protocol and is documented rather than hidden.

**Example.**

```python
from recordstream.projection import project
from recordstream.sources.range import RangeSource

# the SOURCE's own project() runs; the window is sliced out of it
list(project(RangeSource(source=indexable, start=1, stop=4), ("class",)))
# [{'class': 1}, {'class': 2}, {'class': 3}]
```

**What you may change.** Which wrappers forward, how much a reordered view is willing to hold.
What must hold: a view yields its own records in its own order, it never makes a key-restricted
walk more expensive than the source's, a source without the protocol still works, and the walk
stops at the last index it needs.

## 19. A chain that reads files can answer from metadata, verified per record (`for_projection`, 2026-09-10)

**Context.** `Stream.project` forwards to its source only when `ops` is empty — correctly, since
an op may consume the entry another produces. But the shape a file-reading workspace actually
uses is `FilesSource → ReadFile → RenameField`, and there the chain *is* the cost: measured over
a 1430-recording capture library, a filter term costing 143.5 ms per record decoded, where the
sidecar beside each file answers the same question in 0.37 ms. The cheap machinery already
existed (`scan` / `scan_file`, §17); the projection could not reach it.

Two things stood in the way, and both were found by measuring rather than reasoning.

An op cannot know which keys are wanted — that is the caller's question — so it cannot decide
whether a cheap answer suffices. And a scan is not simply "the record minus the payload": both
shipped formats *keep* the payload's entry with an empty array, because the rate, the centre and
the position live on that item and a survey needs them. Measured, `scan` reports 0 samples where
`read` reports 1,000,001 and 100,000,000 — so a filter about the samples would have been answered
from an empty capture, confidently and wrongly.

**Decision.** An op may offer a cheaper variant of ITSELF (`for_projection()`); the stream runs
that chain and verifies the result per record, re-running the real chain when it falls short.
The verification is `formats.answers`, which counts a placeholder as an absence — and a format
states which entries it stands in for (`scan_stands_in`), which `scan_answered` marks.

Three details are load-bearing, each of them a measured failure first:

- The placeholder is **marked, not removed**. Removing it broke the next op outright
  (`RenameField: unknown key 'signal'`), because a chain is written against the record a full
  read produces.
- The marker rides the **value**, not the key. The same chain renames that entry two steps
  later, so a caller checking a name would be checking the wrong one.
- A cheap chain that **raises** is the same verdict as one that falls short. An op reaching for
  something the cheap step could not supply is expected, not exceptional; its answer is the real
  chain's.

**Consequences.** Measured end to end on that library, one filter term: 3.4 min → 0.5 s, with 41
records falling back because they carry no annotations at all — the cheap answer is right about
them, and "did you get what you asked for?" cannot tell *absent* from *not read*. That is the
price of a rule with no promises in it, and it is per record rather than per walk. The cheap path
is refused where the stream would not run sequentially (workers, a chunk size, a stream-level
op): each would have to be re-derived to stay faithful, and the measured case needs none of them.

**Example.**

```python
stream = Stream(source=FilesSource(root=captures, pattern="*/*.json"),
                ops=[ReadFile(), RenameField(src="signal", dst="input")])

list(project(stream, ("regions",)))   # sidecars only — no capture decoded
list(project(stream, ("input",)))     # every capture read; the marker said the scan could not
```

**What you may change.** Which ops offer a cheap variant, what a format stands in for, when the
cheap path is refused. What must hold: a placeholder is marked on the value and counts as an
absence, a record the cheap chain drops is not re-run (dropping is a decision about the file, not
the keys), and a cheap chain that cannot finish yields to the real one instead of to an error.

## 20. `ToTensor` converts; the channel layout, the value range and the element type are ops of their own (2026-09-27)

**Context.** `ToTensor` used to do four jobs: transpose to CHW, turn an array into a tensor, force
a channel layout (`mode`), and rescale (`normalize`, on by default). The rescale could not know the
input's range, so it guessed: `uint8` ÷ 255, and any other value whose maximum was above 1 also
÷ 255. The guess is wrong for data that is already scaled — an ImageNet-standardized image
(`-2.12 .. 2.64`) came out `-0.008 .. 0.010`, a linear-power spectrogram (`0.001 .. 800`) came out
`0 .. 3.14`, and nothing raised. The workspace's own configs had learned to write
`normalize: false` after a standardization, which is the symptom of a default that is wrong.

**Decision.** `ToTensor` converts an array to a CHW tensor of the same element type and nothing
else. Each value change is a separately named, separately placed op, run on numpy before it:
`ConvertMode` (channel layout, through PIL), `Scale` (value range, `[source_min, source_max]` →
`[target_min, target_max]`) and `ToType` (element type, values unchanged). Each refuses what it
cannot do honestly instead of guessing: `Scale` with a blank bound on a float (a float has no full
range), `ToType` complex → real and values an integer type cannot hold, `ConvertMode` anything but
`uint8`.

Two choices inside that are deliberate:

- **A blank `field` means every `Image` and nothing else.** A `Mask` beside it holds class ids;
  scaling one turns every id into a fraction and a later integer cast turns them all into zero,
  silently. Reaching a mask, a spectrogram or a signal's payload takes an explicit `field`.
- **`Scale`'s blank source range is the integer TYPE's range**, not the data's. The data's own
  min/max would change the brightness per image — a different normalization for every record.
  The cost is the con case: a 12-bit sensor stored as `uint16` must name `source_max: 4095`.

**Consequences.** A chain now says what it does to its values in its own ops list, the same
spelling for torch and channels-last engines (a Keras chain omits `ToTensor` and keeps `Scale`,
where it used to lose the rescale along with the transpose). A chain that relied on the old
default gets a `uint8` tensor, which a model refuses loudly (measured on a `Conv2d`: `Input type (unsigned char) and bias type (float) should be the same`) rather
than training on wrong values. A saved canvas holding a `ToTensor` node loses its first two widgets
(`normalize`, `mode`), so its remaining widget values read shifted; no shipped canvas holds one.

**Example.**

```yaml
ops:
  - !class:recordstream.ops.image.ConvertMode {mode: RGB}   # RGBA / grayscale rows -> 3 channels
  - !class:recordstream.ops.numpy.Scale {}                  # uint8 0..255 -> float32 0..1
  - !class:recordstream.ops.torch.ToTensor {}               # HWC -> CHW, nothing else
```

**What you may change.** The element types `ToType` offers, the modes `ConvertMode` offers, new
value ops of the same shape. What must hold: `ToTensor` changes no value, and no op guesses an
input's range from its values.

## 21. An algorithm declares its params, inputs and outputs; the op is derived (`Algorithm`, 2026-09-27)

**Context.** An op that reads named record entries and writes named entries (a measurement, a
filter, a type-changing conversion) had to say the same thing up to five times: a constructor
parameter per slot to name its entry (`field`, `<input>_field`, `output`), a `resolve_item` call per
input, a hand-kept `consumes` / `produces` for the chain checker (§16), a private `_last_*` field
behind a confluid `@output` property so a later step could read the value, and finally the
computation. Nothing checked that the copies agreed. Measured on a consumer's hand-written
noise-floor op: 34 lines of code, of which the computation was 8. The same op rewritten as an
algorithm is 10 lines and gives the same number (`-100.0449` dB on the same spectrogram, 14.81 ms
against 14.87 ms per record; 2.6 µs of added cost per record with the computation removed).

The second pressure came from tools. A generated per-node tool (an LLM re-running one node with new
settings) needs three lists: the settings it may change, the entries the node reads, and what it
returns. Before this record, only the first was derivable from the class.

**Decision.** An `Algorithm` subclass declares three kinds of slot as class attributes and writes
`compute()`:

* `name: type = Param(default=..., doc=...)` is a setting. The base generates a keyword-only
  constructor from the params, plus `keys`, with a real `__signature__`, annotations and an `Args:`
  docstring. `to_pydantic`, `parse_param_docs`, `dump` and confluid's validation therefore see an
  ordinary constructor, and confluid needed no change.
* `name: type = Input(doc=...)` is read from the record entry `name`.
* `name: type = Output(doc=..., replaces=...)` is written to the record entry `name`, or back into
  the entry an input was read from. The base installs one read-only confluid `@output` property per
  output, holding the last computed value, so `bind: step.name` works unchanged.

`compute()` reads params and inputs as `self.<name>` and returns every output by name. The base
provides `run(**inputs)` (standalone), `__call__(record)` (the op), `consumes` / `produces` (derived,
following `keys` and `replaces`) and `algorithm_spec()`.

Alternatives rejected, each measured or shown on a concrete case:

* **Decorators (`@param`, `@input`).** Python only allows decorators on functions and classes, not on
  attributes.
* **Annotation markers (`percentile: Param[float] = 25.0`).** They read well, but a type checker
  cannot tell from an annotation that an input is not a constructor argument. With
  `dataclass_transform`, mypy demanded `spectrogram` and `noise_floor_db` as arguments and refused
  the correct call `NoiseFloor(percentile=30.0)`; without it, mypy checks no call at all. Field
  specifiers carry `init: Literal[False]`, and mypy then reports exactly the typo, the wrong type,
  and an input passed to the constructor.
* **`compute()` assigning outputs (`self.background = ...`).** An output would need a setter, and
  confluid treats a settable property as a configuration knob, so every output would appear as a
  setting in every form and schema.
* **One `<slot>_field` parameter per slot** (the earlier convention for multi-input ops). It adds one
  setting per slot to every form and tool schema. One `keys` mapping carries the same information
  and is validated against the declared slot names.
* **Finding an input by type when its entry is missing** (the "blank field = first of that type"
  rule of `resolve_item`). Existing pipelines would need no change, but which entry an op reads would
  then be decided only while it runs, and `check_chain` could no longer say before a run what a
  pipeline needs. Inputs are found by name only; a pipeline that names the entry differently says so
  once, with `keys` or a `RenameField`.
* **In-place writing configured in every YAML (`keys: {kept: boxes}`).** It works, but an op whose job
  is to replace what it read would, whenever one config forgot the line, quietly add a second entry
  next to the original. `Output(replaces="boxes")` declares it once, in the class.

**Consequences.** The "type-changing op" shape of §1 (subclass `Transform`, override `__call__`) is
superseded for new ops: reading named entries and writing named entries is an algorithm. `Transform`
with kernels stays for "every value of a type" ops, and library transforms still run as they are.
Existing hand-written ops keep working and migrate one at a time. `run()` puts the inputs on a
shallow copy of the object, so the configured instance never holds a record's arrays, and the op
pickles into spawn workers like any other object. The generated constructor is regenerated only for
the first algorithm class and for a subclass that adds a param. Regenerating it otherwise would
discard the validation wrapper confluid's `@configurable` put on the parent's constructor.

Two limits are accepted. The word "input" means two things: confluid's `input_specs()` lists
**constructor** arguments (for an algorithm, the params and `keys`), while an algorithm's record
inputs come from `algorithm_spec()`. And `keys` is declared to the type checker under
`TYPE_CHECKING` on `Algorithm`, which sits below a private decorated base class, because a type
checker collects fields only from classes derived from the decorated one.

**Example.**

```python
class BackgroundLevel(Algorithm):
    percentile: float = Param(default=25.0, doc="Percentile rank across the per-row medians.")
    image: Image = Input(doc="The image to read.")
    background: float = Output(doc="The background level.")

    def compute(self):
        per_row = np.median(np.asarray(self.image, dtype=np.float64), axis=1)
        return {"background": float(np.percentile(per_row, self.percentile))}

BackgroundLevel(percentile=30.0).run(image=image)           # {'background': 10.0}
BackgroundLevel(keys={"image": "photo"})({"photo": image})  # {'photo': ..., 'background': 10.0}
BackgroundLevel().consumes                                   # {'image': 'Image'}
```

**What you may change.** New slot options (a per-slot `doc` format, a unit), more derived views of
the declarations (a generated tool description), better messages. What must hold: the author never
touches a record; every tool-facing view is derived from the three declarations, never declared a
second time; outputs stay read-only; inputs are found by name only; `compute()` returns every output.
Usage: [algorithm.md](algorithm.md).
